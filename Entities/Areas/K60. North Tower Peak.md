# K60. North Tower Peak

If the characters climb the stairs to this area, read:

The stairs end at a dark and dreary room with manacles attached to the walls. In the middle of the room is a wood-framed bed fitted with leather restraints. At the foot of the bed rests a closed iron chest, is lid sculpted with an emblem.

A wooden ladder leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling. Thin streams of water drip through the trapdoor's rotting wood, forming a puddle around the base of the ladder.

The ceiling here is 9 feet high. The manacles are rusted and can be easily torn from the walls. The trapdoor in the ceiling leads to the tower rooftop (area K60a).

The emblem worked into the lid of the iron chest is Strahd's family crest. (Show the players Strahd's crest.) Cyrus Belview (see area K62) stashed the chest here for safekeeping.

## Treasure 

The iron chest is locked, and its key is with Cyrus Belview in area K62.
The chest contains a bejeweled gold crown (worth 2,500 gp) resting on a silk pillow.

## Teleport Destination

Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 arrive in the middle of the room.

## Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is inside the iron chest.
If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is standing next to the iron chest.

## K60a. North Tower Rooftop

A cold wind greets you atop the tower roof, its rain-slicked flagstones surrounded by a twenty-foot-diameter ring of stone battlements. The thunderclouds above suddenly coalesce into the terrible visage of Strahd. The face utters a ghastly moan as thousands of bats fly out of its gaping maw and descend upon the tower.

Characters who remain on the roof are accosted by ten swarms of bats, which arrive in 3 rounds. If the characters descend into the tower, the bats don't follow and instead fly into the high tower (area K59), descend its central shaft (area K18a), and roost in the catacombs (area K84).

The courtyard lies 260 feet below, and the roof of the keep is 130 feet below.
