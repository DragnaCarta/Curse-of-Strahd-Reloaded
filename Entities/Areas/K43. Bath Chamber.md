# K43. Bath Chamber 

Red satin curtains hang in archways at both ends of the south wall in this dark room. Between them, in the center of the chamber, stands a large, ornate iron tub with clawed feet. The tub is full of blood.

Both curtained archways lead to area K44.

## Tormented Spirit

The spirit of Varushka, a maid, haunts this chamber. She took her own life when Strahd began feeding on her, denying him the chance to turn her into a vampire spawn.

The blood in the tub isn't real, but rather a manifestation of Varushka's tormented spirit. If the blood is disturbed in any way, read:

A blood-drenched creature explodes out of the tub and attaches to the ceiling, cackling maniacally. Blood pours off its pale flesh, bony limbs, and stringy hair as it scuttles away.

%% --- Page 92 --- %%
The creature that erupts from the tub is no more real than the blood. It can't be harmed and doesn't attack. It scuttles across the ceiling, disappearing into area K44 through one of the archways. Once there, it disappears.
