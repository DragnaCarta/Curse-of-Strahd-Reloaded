# K88. Tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia

This tomb rests in hushed silence. Tall, stained glass windows dominate the eastern walls, allowing dim light to fall on two coffins resting atop white marble slabs. The one against the north wall is marked King Barov von Zarovich, and the one against the south wall is marked Queen Ravenovia van Roeyen. The vaulted ceiling thirty feet overhead is inlaid with a beautiful gold mosaic.

KING BAROV AND QUEEN RAVENOVIA
The stained glass windows are so dirty on the outside as to be nearly opaque. The windows don't open, but they can be smashed easily. Anyone who looks upward through a window can see, 110 feet above, the castle's stone overlook (area K6). Anyone who falls out a window here plummets almost 900 feet to the base of the Pillarstone of Ravenloft.

Prying the gold from the ceiling of this tomb would be a long and tedious effort for little reward.
The north coffin holds a beautifully sculpted, life-sized wax effigy of Strahd's father, King Barov. The old king's bones lie in a compartment beneath his effigy.

The south coffin holds the skeleton of Strahd's mother, Queen Ravenovia. (The magic that was meant to preserve her earthly remains failed years ago.) A tattered white shroud covers her bones.

## Fortunes of Ravenloft 

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it lies atop Queen Ravenovia's coffin.
If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is in a frenzy of rage and despair.
