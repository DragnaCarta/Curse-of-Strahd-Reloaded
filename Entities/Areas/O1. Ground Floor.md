# O1. Ground Floor

The ground floor has been converted into a makeshift kitchen, but the room is filthy. Baskets and old dishware are piled everywhere. Adding to the clutter is a peddler's cart, a chicken coop, a heavy wooden trunk, and a pretty wooden cabinet with flowers painted on its doors. In addition to the clucking of the chickens, you hear toads croaking.

The sweet smell of pastries blends horridly with a stench that burns your nostrils. The awful odor comes out of an open, upright barrel in the center of the room.
Warmth issues from a brick oven against one wall, and a crumbling staircase ascends the wall across from it. Shrieks and cackles from somewhere higher up cause the old mill to shudder.

The ceiling here is 8 feet high. If the characters explore the room, read:

Small human bones litter the flagstone floor.

Baking in the oven are a dozen dream pastries. Morgantha checks on them every 10 minutes. The staircase curls up to area 02.

The barrel holds glistening, greenish-black demon ichor. Morgantha can use the barrel as a font for a scrying spell. She can also knock on the barrel three times as an action to summon a dretch. The demon crawls out of the barrel at the end of Morgantha's turn and obeys the night hag's commands for 1 hour, after which it dissolves into a pool of ichor. Morgantha can summon up to nine dretches in this manner before the ichor is gone.

Morgantha's cabinet contains wooden bowls full of herbs and baking ingredients, including flour, sugar, and several gourds of powdered bone. Hanging on the inside of the cabinet doors are a dozen locks of hair. Amid various concoctions are three small, labeled containers that hold elixirs. The first elixir, labeled "Youth," is a golden syrup that magically makes the imbiber appear younger and more attractive for 24 hours. The second elixir, labeled "Laughter," is a nonmagical red tea that infects the imbiber with cackle fever (see "Diseases" in chapter 8, "Running the Game," of the Dungeon Master's Guide). The third elixir, a greenish milky liquid labeled "Mother's Milk," is actually a dose of pale tincture (see "Poisons" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

The chicken coop contains three chickens, a rooster, and a few laid eggs.
The wooden trunk has tiny holes bored into its lid and contains a hundred croaking toads. Several toads escape if the lid is lifted, but they are harmless.
