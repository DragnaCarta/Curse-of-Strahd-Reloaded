# X40. Sealed Treasury

The amber doors to the south are sealed with an arcane lock spell. The password to suppress the spell is "Dhaviton." A character can push open the doors with a successful DC 25 Strength check. The doors (AC 15, 60 hit points) can also be smashed. If the doors are reduced to 0 hit points, a greater invisibility spell is cast on the amber golem in this room. The spell lasts for 1 minute.

Piles of treasure are heaped against the west and east walls of this stone room.

If the golem is visible, add:

A ten-foot-tall statue carved from amber in the likeness of a hawk-headed humanoid stands in a wide alcove to the north. Behind it, a crack has formed in the wall.

The ceiling here is 30 feet high and flat. The statue in the northern alcove is an amber golem (use the stat block for the stone golem in the Monster Manual). It attacks any creature that disturbs the treasure. The golem can leave the room but can't leave the Amber Temple.
