# K25. Audience Hall

<div class="description"><p>Dim light from the courtyard falls into this great hall through the broken glass and iron latticework of a large window in the west wall. This immense room is a place of chilly, brooding darkness. Empty iron sconces dot the walls. Hundreds of dust-laden cobwebs drape the hall, hiding the ceiling from view. Directly across from the window stand a set of double doors in the east wall. Farther south, a single door also leads from the east wall. Staircases at both ends of the north wall lead down. At the far southern end of the hall, a large wooden throne stands atop a marble dais. The high-backed throne faces south, away from most of the room.</p></div>

A secret door in the south wall leads to area K13. It is hidden by dust and cobwebs, and requires a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check to find.
Both staircases in the north wall lead down to area K19. The eastern double doors can be pulled open to reveal area K26 beyond. The single door in the east wall opens into area K30.

## Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it lies on the marble dais, just behind the throne.
If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is sitting on the wooden throne.
