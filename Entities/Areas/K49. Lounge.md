# K49. Lounge

As thunder shakes the tower, heavy beams groan under the weight of the ceiling. Three ornate lanterns hang by chains from these beams, each casting a dim glow. The curved west wall is fitted with three windows of leaded glass in steel latticework. A bookcase sits on the east wall between two doors. Plush, overstuffed chairs and couches are placed about the room. The fabric has faded with age, and the patterns it depicts are nearly gone. Lounging on one couch is a handsome young man whose attire, while elegant, is worn and faded.

The youthful man on the couch is Escher, a dashing vampire spawn to whom Strahd has shown favor in the past. Escher is feeling somewhat neglected of late and has retreated here until Strahd's mood improves. If attacked, he hurls himself out the window and lands like a cat on the roof of the keep (area K53). He leads pursuers right to Strahd, wherever the lord of the castle happens to be (and regardless of whether the characters are ready to face Strahd).

In conversation, Escher displays wit with a hint of melancholy. Beneath his arch mood is a dread that Strahd is growing bored of him and will lock him in the catacombs (area K84) with Strahd's other castoff consorts.

The leaded windows are fitted with iron hinges and can be opened. They can be locked from the inside, though they are currently unlocked. The leaded glass doesn't allow for much of a view. If a character opens a window and leaves it open, there's a 50 percent chance that a vampire spawn crawling around the outside wall of the tower notices the open window and investigates.

The books in the bookcase have no value and aren't much help to the characters. Some of the titles found on the bookshelf include Embalming: The Lost Art, Life Among the Undead: Learning to Cope, Castle Building 101, and Goats of the Balinok Mountains.

## Treasure 

On the third finger of his left hand, Escher wears a platinum ring engraved with tiny roses and thorns (worth 150 gp ). Around his neck, he wears a gold and ruby pendant (worth 750 gp ).
