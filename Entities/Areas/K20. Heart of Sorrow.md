# K20. Heart of Sorrow 

<div class="description"><p>A mosaic floor adds a touch of color to the otherwise dark, cold, empty tower that rises above you. A spiral staircase rises slowly into darkness, hugging the outer wall. In the center of the room, another set of stairs leads down.</p></div>

The staircase in the center of the floor (area K20a) leads down to area K71.
The spiral staircase has no railing and connects the main floor of the castle with each level above it. First, the staircase climbs 50 feet to a landing (shown on map 4), from which an open archway leads to area K13. East of that opening is a secret door that conceals a ladder leading down to area K34.

The stairs ascend another 40 feet to another landing (shown on map 5), with archways that lead to areas K45 and K46, and then climb another 100 feet to a landing beneath the tower's heart (shown on map 8). The staircase wraps around the heart, ending at the top of the tower (area K60).

## The Heart

The tower, including the spiral staircase, is alive. When the characters set foot on the staircase for the first time, read:

<div class="description"><p>As you step onto the spiral staircase, a reddish light flares high overhead, then settles into a dull, pulsing red glow. You now see the full immensity of this tower. The spiral staircase circles up the tower's full height. The tower, sixty feet wide at its base, becomes narrower as it climbs. At the pinnacle of the hollow tower, a large crystal heart pulsates with red light. Above the heart, the stairs continue upward.</p></div>

Have the characters and the Heart of Sorrow roll initiative. If the characters leave the tower and later return, they can reroll initiative, but the heart's initiative count doesn't change.

The awakened tower shakes and pitches on the Heart of Sorrow's initiative count. Any creature on the stairs or hanging on a tower wall at the start of the heart's turn must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall to the base of the tower. Characters who are crawling on the staircase or who lie prone on the stairs succeed automatically.

The Heart of Sorrow is a 10-foot-diameter red crystal heart that floats near the top of the tower. Characters standing on the nearby stairs can make melee attacks against the heart, provided their weapons have a reach of at least 10 feet. The glass heart has AC 15 and 50 hit points. If the heart is reduced to 0

hit points, it shatters, and its crystal shards transform into blood, which rains down on the tower interior and staircase. The destruction of the Heart of Sorrow causes the tower to stop shuddering, and the interior of the tower becomes dark. Destroying the heart earns the characters 1,500 XP.

Strahd and the Heart of Sorrow are connected, such that any damage Strahd takes is transferred to the heart. If the heart absorbs damage that drops it to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and Strahd takes any leftover damage. The Heart of Sorrow regains all its hit points at dawn if it has at least 1 hit point remaining.

The Heart of Sorrow is held aloft by the will of Strahd. Casting dispel magic on it has no effect.
Animated Halberds. Mounted on the walls along the section of staircase nearest the heart are ten animated halberds; use the stat block for the flying sword in the Monster Manual, but increase each halberd's damage to $1 d 10+1$ and reduce its $A C$ to 15 . The halberds attack any creature that threatens the Heart of Sorrow.

### Vampire Spawn. 
Strahd senses if any damage is done to the Heart of Sorrow and sends four vampire spawn to destroy those responsible. These vampire spawn are former adventurers whom Strahd defeated long ago. They use their Spider Climb feature to scuttle along the tower walls and arrive in 3 rounds.
