# K9. Guests' Hall 

Torchlight flutters against the walls of this vaulted hall. To the east, an arched hallway stretches for twenty feet, ending at a spiral staircase that goes up and down. Next to the hallway, a suit of armor, oiled and glistening, stands at attention in a shallow alcove. To the west, large double doors hang slightly open, and a steady bright light escapes through the opening. Swells of organ music come from behind the doors, spilling their melody of power and defeat into the hall.

The suit of armor standing in the alcove is merely a normal suit of plate armor that is well cared for.
The staircase leads down to area K61 and up to area K30. The double doors provide access to area K10.
