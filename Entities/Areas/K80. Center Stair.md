# K80. Center Stair 

If the characters enter this area through the door at the bottom of the stairs, read:

The door creaks open to reveal a stone staircase between rough masonry walls. There is little dust on the steps, but light fog tumbles down the steps from above.

If the characters enter this area at the top of the staircase, read:

The rough-hewn corridor ends at a stone staircase that descends to the south. Flanked by walls of rough masonry and relatively free of dust, these stairs descend before ending at a lonely door.

The stairs slope at a 45-degree angle for a distance of 20 feet horizontally, connecting areas K78 and K81.
