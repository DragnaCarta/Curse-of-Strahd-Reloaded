# WotC source:
# W15. Brown Mold 

If the characters open the secret door, read:

It takes some effort to push open the secret door, and you are greeted by a blast of cold air. A dark tunnel stretches for fifteen feet, ending at an archway beyond which lies a shallow cave.

Characters who have a light source can see brown mold covering the walls, floor, and ceiling around the archway and the cave beyond. Growing throughout this area, keeping the wine cellar cool, are ten patches of brown mold (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide). The characters are safe from the mold as long as they keep their distance.
