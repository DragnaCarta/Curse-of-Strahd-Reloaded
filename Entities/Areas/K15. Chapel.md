# K15. Chapel 

<div class="description"><p>Dim, colored light filters through tall, broken, and boarded-up windows of stained glass, illuminating the ancient chapel of Ravenloft. A few bats flutter about near the top of the ninety-foot-high domed ceiling. A balcony runs the length of the west wall, fifty feet above the floor. In the center of the balcony, two dark shapes are slumped in tall chairs.</p>

<p>Benches coated with centuries of dust lie about the floor in jumbled disarray. Beyond this debris, lit by a piercing shaft of light, an altar stands upon a stone platform. The sides of the altar are carved with bas-reliefs of angelic figures entwined with grape vines. The light from above falls directly on a silver statuette. A cloaked figure is draped over the altar, and a black mace lies on the floor near its feet.</p></div>

The figure slumped on the altar is all that remains of Gustav Herrenghast, a lawful evil human cleric who tried to obtain the Icon of Ravenloft and did not survive the attempt. See "Treasure" below for more information on the icon and Gustav's possessions.

A sculpted stone railing cordons off the upstairs balcony, which is described in area K28.

## Treasure

The statuette on the altar is an artifact called the Icon of Ravenloft (see appendix C). Any evil creature that touches the statuette must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 88 (16d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The statuette is safe for all creatures to handle once it is no longer in contact with the altar.

Gustav's corpse wears a handsome, fur-lined black cloak embroidered with golden thread (worth 250 gp ) and a suit of chain mail, both nonmagical. Gustav's black mace is a mace of terror.

## Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it lies on the floor behind the altar.
If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is among the bats fluttering below the ceiling or he is standing at one end of the chapel-a dark shape in the vast hall.
