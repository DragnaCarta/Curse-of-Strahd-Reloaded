# X21. West Staircase

Three 10-foot-long staircases separated by 10-foot-square landings connect areas X18 and X36. Thick dust covering the stairs has not been disturbed in ages.

The uppermost landing has secret doors set into its north and south walls. The south door opens into area X19, and the north door opens into area X20.
