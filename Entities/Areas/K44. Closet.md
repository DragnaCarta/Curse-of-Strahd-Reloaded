# K44. Closet 

The walls here are lined with iron hooks, upon which hang black capes and formal wear. Two arched windows in the south wall are covered by heavy curtains.

Twenty-eight capes and sixteen sets of fine clothes are stored here. Red satin drapes hang in the archways that connect this closet to the adjoining bath chamber (area K43).
