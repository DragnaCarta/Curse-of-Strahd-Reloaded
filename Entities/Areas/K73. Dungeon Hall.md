# K73. Dungeon Hall

The following boxed text assumes that the characters arrive by way of the staircase to the east (area K21). Adjust as needed if the characters enter this hall from another direction.

The stairs descend into black, still water that fills an arched hallway before you. The water's surface is like dark, mirrored glass, disturbed only occasionally by the "thwick" of a drop falling from the ceiling. Twenty feet ahead, arched doorways lead downward from each side of the hallway. In each arched doorway, an iron door stands closed and partially submerged. You hear a weak cry for help from beyond the south door.

MAP: TRAPS IN AREA K73
The water is 3 feet deep in the hallway and opaque. The steps on both sides of the hallway descend another 2 feet before ending at the iron doors to the north and south.

The floor beneath the water isn't as solid as one might expect. There is a safe path around several weight-sensitive trapdoors (see the Traps in Area K73 diagram), but the water makes it impossible to see where the trapdoors are. For every 10 pounds of weight on a trapdoor, there is a 5 percent chance that the trapdoor will open. The 10-foot-deep pit under each trapdoor contains a magic teleport trap that activates as soon as the trapdoor opens. Any Medium or smaller creature on a trapdoor when it opens plunges into the pit and is teleported to a cell in either area K74 or K75, as the diagram indicates.

When a character sets off a trap, other characters in the hall see an explosion of air and water fly up around the triggering character (air that was trapped in the pit is released suddenly when the trapdoor opens). The triggering character suddenly falls from sight. An instant later, the trapdoor closes, leaving only a slowly dissipating swirl in the water. It doesn't open again until 24 hours have passed, at which point its teleport trap is recharged.

Characters who fall victim to the teleport traps are transported to dungeon cells closed with iron bars and under 5 feet of brackish water (areas K74 and K75).
