# Z6. Kiril's Cave

At the back of this cave hangs a curtain made of human skin.

When home, Kiril Stoyanovich sleeps here in wolf form.
Behind the ghastly curtain of stitched flesh is a 10-foot-high, 10-foot-wide tunnel with rough-hewn stairs leading up, interspersed with landings. The tunnel ends at a secret door, beyond which lies area Z8. The secret door is easy to spot from inside the tunnel (no ability check required).
