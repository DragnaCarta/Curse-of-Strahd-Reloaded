# X9. Lecture Hall

This chamber is brightly lit by red copper lanthorns that hang from the ceiling. The walls are sheathed in amber that has been shaped into bas-reliefs of wizards with spellbooks. Stairs to the north and south descend twenty feet to an obsidian lectem, behind which a slab of black slate hangs from chains. Between the stairs are descending rows of red marble benches.

The hanging lanthorns have continual flame spells cast on them. The black slate slab once served as a chalkboard and has a few chalk marks on it.

Hiding behind the lectern is Vilnius (NE male human mage) and his invisible quasit familiar. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher notice him. A character who actively searches the room for hidden occupants spots Vilnius with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.

Vilnius wears scorched robes, his unkempt hair is half burned away, and his face and arms are covered with blisters from magic fire. He is the apprentice of Jakarion, the dead wizard in area X17. After the flameskulls there incinerated his master, the wounded Vilnius retreated here. He eats vermin to survive. The amber golem has been patrolling the hallway outside (area X8), and Vilnius won't leave this room until he knows the golem has been destroyed.

Vilnius is a greedy, treacherous coward. He curses his dead master for leading them to this wretched land. If the characters try to befriend him, he is suspicious of their intentions. He would like to retrieve his dead master's staff and spellbook, but otherwise he has no interest in exploring more of the Amber Temple. He knows the following information about the place:

- The temple is a haven for forbidden knowledge.
- Flameskulls-constructs made from the remains of dead wizards-guard the temple.
- Barbaric mountain folk use the temple for shelter.


## Treasure 

Vilnius carries his spellbook, which contains all the spells he has prepared. He also has a gold amulet shaped like an upside-down V hidden under his robes. Of exquisite design, the amulet is worth 1,000 gp. It is the control amulet for the shield guardian in area X35.

Although he can tell that the amulet is magical, he doesn't know its purpose. The amulet thrums when it comes within 10 feet of the shield guardian. If Vilnius realizes what the amulet does, he won't part with it.
