# WotC source:
# Z1. Cave Mouth 

The open jaws of the wolf's head form a fifteen-foot-high canopy of rock over the cave mouth, held up by natural pillars of rock. The ceiling rises to a height of twenty feet inside the cave. Torches in iron brackets line the walls. From somewhere deep inside, you hear the echoing sounds of a flute. Some of the notes are discordant painfully so.

The guards in area Z2 spot characters in the cave mouth who aren't hidden. Characters can track the sound of the flute to area Z3.

## Development

If the characters arrive here with Emil Toranescu (see chapter 4, area K75a) in their company or their custody, he can command the other werewolves in the den not to attack the characters as they make their way inside.
