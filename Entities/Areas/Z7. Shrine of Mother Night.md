# Z7. Shrine of Mother Night

Rough-hewn stairs lead down to a torchlit cave and a bizarre sight: wide-eyed children stand behind wooden bars and stare at you in terrified silence. The cave holds six wooden cages, their lids held shut with heavy rocks. Two of the cages are empty, and each of the others holds a pair of frightened children.

A crude wooden statue stands between the cages. It bears the rough likeness of a wolf-headed woman draped in garlands of vines and night flowers. Piled around the statue's base is an incredible amount of treasure. A woman in shredded clothes kneels before the statue. Behind the statue, two maggot-ridden corpses hang from iron shackles bolted to the wall.

The ceiling here is 20 feet high. The statue is a crude depiction of Mother Night. Kneeling before it is a werewolf in human form named Zuleika Toranescu, who is the wife of Emil (see chapter 4, area K75a). Believing her mate to be dead by Strahd's hand, she prays to Mother Night for guidance, hoping that the goddess might hold enough sway over Strahd to persuade him to free her beloved.

## ZULEIKA TORANESCU 

Kiril has ordered Zuleika to guard the prisoners. If the characters rescue Emil and return him safely to Zuleika, she gladly releases the children. If the characters confirm that Emil is truly dead, either by their hand or Strahd's, she still might let the prisoners go if the characters help her deal with Kiril Stoyanovich, whom she blames above all. Zuleika sees the characters as the answer to her prayers and asks them to kill Kiril when he returns from his latest hunt (see "Leader of the Pack" in the "Special Events" section below).

Each of the eight children imprisoned here has AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. To determine a child's age in years, roll $1 d 6+6$. The rocks piled atop each occupied cage can be knocked or lifted off, allowing the cages to be opened. The children are in shock. Those who are set free don't wander far from the characters for fear of being eaten by wolves and werewolves.

The corpses hanging on the wall behind the statue are two Barovian adults, a man and a woman, killed by the pack and presented as offerings to Mother Night. The werewolves consider the feasting maggots to be emblematic of Mother Night's "feedings." When the flesh of these corpses has been eaten away, the pack searches for new offerings to take their place.

## Treasure

The treasure piled around the base of Mother Night's statue includes:

- 4,500 cp, 900 sp, and 250 gp (all coins of mintages foreign to Barovia)
- Thirty 50 gp gemstones and seven 100 gp gemstones
- Twelve pieces of plain gold jewelry (worth 25 gp each) and a finely wrought gold cloak-pin inlaid with shards of jet (worth 250 gp )
- An ivory drinking horn engraved with dancing dryads and satyr pipe players (worth 250 gp )
- An ornate electrum censer with platinum filigree (worth 750 gp )

Anyone who steals from Mother Night is cursed. The werewolves know this, and thus don't go out of their way to guard the hoard.
Any creature that takes treasure from this pile is haunted by horrible dreams every night lasting from dusk until dawn. The curse affects only the creature that did the pilfering and isn't passed on to anyone else who might come into possession of the item. Returning a stolen item to the treasure pile doesn't end the curse.

A creature cursed in this way gains no benefit from finishing a short or long rest at night (resting during the day works normally, since the curse is dormant from dawn to dusk). A greater restoration or a remove curse spell cast on the creature ends the curse on it. The curse on the creature also ends if it leaves Barovia.

## Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it's lying amid the other items at the base of the statue. The curse described above applies to this treasure as well.
