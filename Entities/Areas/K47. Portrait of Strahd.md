# K47. Portrait of Strahd 

You come to a dark landing ten feet wide and twenty feet long. A cold draft of wind rushes down the spiral staircase at the north end of the east wall and whistles mournfully through the room before streaming down the stairs to the south.

An ornate, square rug covers the floor to the south. Set into the west wall is an ironbound wooden door with a wooden trapdoor set into the floor in front of it. Hanging on the north wall above the trapdoor is a framed portrait of a handsome, well-dressed man with a serene yet penetrating gaze.

The ornate rug is actually a rug of smothering. It attacks creatures, other than undead, that move across it or anyone who tries to move it or otherwise disturb it. Underneath the rug is a bare stone floor.

The wooden, square trapdoor is 4 feet on a side and as thick as the floor, with recessed iron hinges and an iron ring built into the side opposite the hinges. Pulling up on the ring opens the door. Below the trapdoor, characters see one of two things: either a 170 -foot-deep shaft (area K31a) or, if the elevator trap has been activated (see area K61), a stone elevator compartment with a secret hatch in its top.

The portrait on the wall depicts Strahd von Zarovich before he became a vampire. Even in life, he was pale. The eyes of the portrait seem to watch and follow the characters as they explore the area. The picture frame is bolted to the wall and can't be removed without destroying it.

If the characters attack the rug or the picture, or if they attempt to remove either item, the guardian portrait (see appendix D) attacks.
