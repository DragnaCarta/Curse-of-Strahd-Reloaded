# N6. Coffin Maker's Shop

This uninviting shop is two stories tall and has a sign shaped like a coffin above the front door. All of the window shutters are closed up tight, and a deathly silence surrounds the establishment.

Henrik van der Voort (LE male human commoner) is a mediocre carpenter and a troubled, lonely man. He profits from the deaths of others, and no one desires his company, because of the ghastly nature of his handiwork. One night several months ago, Strahd visited Henrik in the guise of an imposing, well-dressed nobleman named Vasili von Holtz and promised the coffin maker "good business" in exchange for his help. Since then, Henrik's workshop has become the lair of a pack of vampire spawn-former adventurers who were turned by Strahd. These vampires are lying low for the time being.

HENRIK VAN DER VOORT
The vampires plan to attack St. Andral's church (see "St. Andral's Feast" in the "Special Events" section at the end of this chapter). When Henrik learned about the sacred bones buried under the church, the vampire spawn ordered him to steal the bones, which Henrik paid Milivoj the gravedigger (see area N1) to do.

Every window of Henrik's shop is a latticework of iron fitted with squares of frosted glass and locked from the inside. The outside doors of the shop are barred shut from within. If the characters knock on one of them, Henrik shouts, "We're closed! Go away!" without opening the door. If the characters accuse Henrik of stealing the bones of St. Andral, he shouts again, "Go away! Leave me alone!"

If the characters break into the store, Henrik offers no resistance. He tells them where to find the bones (in the upstairs bedroom wardrobe, area N6e) and the vampire nest (in the upstairs wood storage room, area N6f).

If the characters report the theft of the bones to the burgomaster, Baron Vallakovich dispatches four guards to arrest Henrik and retrieve the bones. If the guards show up during daylight hours, Henrik surrenders himself and the bones without a fight, claiming that vampires forced him to steal the bones. If the guards come at night, Henrik surrenders himself and tells the guards where the bones are hidden, but he won't retrieve the bones himself for fear of being killed by the vampires.

## N6a. Coffin Storage 

Arranged haphazardly about the floor of this musty, L-shaped room are thirteen wooden coffins.

Henrik stores and displays the coffins he has made in this room. All of them are empty.

## N6b. Junk Room

A table with four chairs is in one corner of this room, with a lantern hanging from a chain directly above. Two well-made cabinets stand against the east wall.

The cabinets are packed with worthless items that Henrik has collected over the years.

## N6c. Workshop

This workshop contains everything a carpenter needs to make coffins and furniture. Three sturdy worktables stretch the length of the west wall.

Henrik builds coffins and keeps his carpenter's tools in this room.

## N6d. Kitchen

This kitchen contains a square table surrounded by chairs and shelves of provisions.

Henrik prepares his meals here.

## N6e. Henrik's Bedroom

This modest bedchamber holds a cot and several well-made pieces of furniture, including a table, a padded chair, a bookshelf, and a wardrobe.

Henrik sleeps here, at night and well into the morning. The bookshelf contains a handful of storybooks and carpenters' manuals that have been handed down from previous generations.

### Treasure. 
The wardrobe in the southeast corner has a secret compartment in its base, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. Inside the compartment are two sacks-a large one containing the bones of St. Andral and a small one containing 30 sp and 12 ep. All of the coins bear the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich.

## N6f. Vampire Nest

This large, drafty room is strung with cobwebs and takes up most of the upper floor. Stacks of wooden planks lie amid several crates marked "JUNK."

The two southernmost crates contain old junk that Henrik has accumulated over the years. The six crates in the northern part of the room are packed with earth and serve as resting places for the six vampire spawn that lair here. If the characters open one of the occupied crates, all of the vampire spa-

burst forth and attack.

### Teleport Destination. 
Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 in Castle Ravenloft arrive at the point marked T on the map.
