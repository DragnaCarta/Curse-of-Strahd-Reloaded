# D. River Ivlis 

When the characters come within sight of this river for the first time, read:

This river flows as clear as a blue winter sky through the valley.

The river is roughly 50 feet wide, with a depth ranging from 5 to 10 feet. Arching stone bridges span the river at two points, one near the village of Barovia (area E) and the other near Tser Falls (area H).
