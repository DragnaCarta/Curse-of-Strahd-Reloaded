# Q43. Hole in Roof

This 20-foot-diameter hole in the mansion's roof is directly above area Q33, the floor of which is 20 feet below. The rubble on the roof surrounding the hole is difficult terrain. The roof is sloped and covered with cracked stone tiles. Climbing the tiled roof requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. A failure by 5 or more causes the climber to slide down to the parapet, landing prone but taking no damage.
