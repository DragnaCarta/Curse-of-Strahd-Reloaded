# X31. Central Catacombs

These catacombs contain the moldy remains of the wizards who once defended the Amber Temple. Later generations of wizards who were corrupted by the evil of the temple smashed the amber sheaths covering the dead wizards' bodies and stole everything of value, leaving the formerly preserved corpses to rot.

You smell the horrid perfume of the ancient dead. Stone niches along the walls of these catacombs hold human-shaped amber husks, bones, and tattered shrouds.

If the characters enter these catacombs, add:

Tall, iron candlesticks stand in alcoves. Their candles ignite as you enter, casting flickering light upon the walls and causing the shattered amber to glitter.

The magic candles ignite when a living creature enters the catacombs and melt away if taken from the area.

More skeletal remains fill niches in the walls of this smaller annex, the amber husks that once preserved them smashed beyond repair.

## X31b. East Catacombs 

The niches set into the wall of this annex lie empty, except for a thick coat of dust.

No wizards were entombed here. This annex is empty.
