# K16. North Chapel Access

<div class="description"><p>This arched room connects a vast chamber to the east and a staircase that rises to the west. Alcoves in the north and south walls hold eight-foot-tall sculptures of helmed knights with muscular builds. Black shadows fall across their faces.</p></div>

The statues are harmless. The vast chamber to the east is the chapel (area K15). The staircase to the west is described in area K29.
