# K76. Torture Chamber

Dark, low shapes thrust up out of the still, brackish water that fills this fifty-foot-square room, the ceiling of which is festooned with hanging chains that look like thick,
black web strands. A balcony set into the north wall overlooks the room and has two large thrones atop it, with a red velvet curtain behind them.

The ceiling is 17 feet above the surface of the water, which is 3 feet deep. The balcony to the north stands 7 feet above the water's surface, 10 feet above
the floor.

If the characters approach the "dark, low shapes" in the water, read:

The dark shapes in the water are racks, iron maidens, stocks, and other instruments of torture. The skeletons of their last victims lie within them, their jaws seemingly
frozen open in silent screams.

As soon as one or more characters move more than 10 feet into the room, six Strahd zombies rise slowly out of the water, their slime-gray arms clawing
upward through the water as they attack.
