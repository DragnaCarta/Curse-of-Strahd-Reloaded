# K51. Closet

This small, wood-paneled room reeks of mildew and has a ten-foot-high ceiling. Iron hooks line the walls, and a dusty black cloak hangs from one hook in the center of the south wall.

The cloak is ordinary. The witches in area K56 placed it here to help them remember which hook opens the secret trapdoor in the ceiling.
The trapdoor can be found after a search of the room and a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Locating the trapdoor doesn't enable someone to discover its opening mechanism. The door has a hidden lock and can be opened by pulling down on the hook from which the black cloak hangs. Once it has been found, the trapdoor can be opened by pulling on the hook, or it can be unlocked by someone using thieves' tools, a knock spell, or similar magic. It swings down when unlocked.
