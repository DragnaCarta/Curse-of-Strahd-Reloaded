# Q41. Dragon's Vault 

The iron door leading to this room hangs open on a single rusty hinge. It has obviously been forced open and no longer closes properly.

The walls of this room are lined with lead. Emptied chests and shattered vases lie strewn upon the floor, their contents plundered.

This vault once held a dragon's trove but was stripped of all valuables long ago.
