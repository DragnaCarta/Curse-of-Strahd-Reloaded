# V2. Tower Door 

The tower door is made of iron, with no visible handles or hinges. In the middle of the door is a large, embossed symbol - a connected series of lines with eight stick figures set around it. Carved into the lintel above the door is a word: Khazan.

Show the players the door symbol to the right. The door is magically locked and trapped, and the symbol on the door is the key to disabling the trap. Magic that would normally unlock the door is neutralized by the tower's spell drain effect (see "Khazan's Spell Drain" earlier in the chapter).

A creature that touches the door without first disabling the trap causes lightning to envelop the tower. Any creature outside the tower and within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, with disadvantage if it is wearing armor made of metal, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one. As long as the effect persists, any creature that enters the lightning for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage. The lightning lasts for 10 minutes.

The third time this trap is triggered, the magic fails and causes the tower to collapse. Each creature inside the tower when it collapses takes 132 (24d10) bludgeoning damage, while those within 20 feet of the tower must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage from falling debris. The collapse not only destroys the tower but also most of its contents, including the animated armor in area V7. The wooden chest in area V7 (as well as the severed head inside it) remains intact but requires $1 \mathrm{~d} 8+2$ hours of digging through rubble to find. The clay golems in area V4 are undamaged but buried under piles of debris. Every hour the characters spend searching through the rubble, they have a 10 percent chance of accidentally unearthing a berserk clay golem.

## Opening the Door 

Each stick figure embossed on the door has differently positioned arms - either bent up or down at the elbow, or sticking straight out to the side. When a creature standing within 5 feet of the door uses an action to imitate the arm positions of all eight stick figures in the proper sequence, the trap is disabled and the door swings open on rusty hinges for 10 minutes. The lines of the symbol on the door reveal the proper sequence. The dance can be performed in one of two ways; a creature must trace the path of the lines, starting at either endpoint. All eight sets of arm positions must be performed, with no repeats, for the sequence to be complete.

If the arm positions are done out of order, a young blue dragon magically appears within 30 feet of the door and attacks all creatures it can see. The characters can keep trying to open the door while the dragon is attacking them. The dragon disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or if the characters open the door.

## Vestibule

Beyond the door is a 5 -foot-square vestibule with a tattered curtain that conceals area V4 beyond. The iron door leading outside can be safely opened from this side. It magically closes after 1 minute unless held open.
