# Q9. Servants' Quarters

Tattered brown drapes cover the windows of this circular room, and a heavy curtain hangs across an archway to the south. Strewn about the floor is the wreckage of half a dozen beds and other pieces of furniture.

Lord Argynvost's household staff once slept here. The room contains nothing of value. Beyond the curtain lies the kitchen (area Q10).
