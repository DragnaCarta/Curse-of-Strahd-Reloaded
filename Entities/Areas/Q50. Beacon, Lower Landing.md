# Q50. Beacon, Lower Landing

A rickety wooden landing and a staircase cling to the walls of this tower. The stairs lead up to another landing twenty feet above, and the floor of the chapel lies sixty feet below.

The landing and the stairs creak and shudder underfoot, but they are safe.

Creaky stairs climb to a wooden landing with three windows that look out over the roof of the mansion. Flanking the windows are two narrow wooden doors.

The landing creaks and groans underfoot, much like in area Q50, but here things aren't so safe. The 10-foot-long section marked T on the map is particularly weak, collapsing under 50 or more pounds of weight. A creature on this section of the landing when it collapses must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet to the landing below (area Q50). The collapse of this section creates a 10 -foot gap in the landing.

The doors lead to the rooftops of the turrets (area Q52).
