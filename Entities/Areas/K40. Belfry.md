# K40. Belfry

%% --- Page 90 --- %%
You can hear the rain and thunder outside, and the air here is cold and damp. Veils and curtains of webbing fill the room, making it hard to gauge its width and depth. A single, narrow path leads to the dark center of the room, where a rope dangles from high above.

The rope is attached to a great bell mounted in a wooden framework 50 feet overhead. Pulling the rope or attempting to climb it brings forth a loud, long "GONG." That sound causes five giant spiders to drop from their webs and attack. The spiders attack only if they are attacked or if the bell is sounded.

Most of the belfry is filled with giant spider webs (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Characters who blunder into them risk becoming stuck.

At the west end of the north wall, behind thick webs, is a secret door that opens into area K41.
