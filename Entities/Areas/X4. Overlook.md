A twenty-foot-wide balcony of black marble with a shattered railing overlooks a vast temple. Black marble staircases at each end of the balcony descend thirty feet to the temple floor. The vaulted ceiling is thirty feet above the balcony. The walls and ceiling are covered in an amber glaze, lending the gloom a golden sheen. A set of amber doors stands closed at the west end of the balcony. A similar pair stands open to the east.

Anyone with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher notice arrow slits in the walls overlooking the temple (see areas X8 and X17 for more information on these arrow slits). If the characters' light source or vision extends 90 feet or more, they can see a large, faceless statue at the far end of the temple (area X5a).

The open doorway to the east leads to area X6. The double doors to the west open into area X15. Characters who listen at the western doors hear gruff humanoid voices beyond, but can't discern what's being said.
