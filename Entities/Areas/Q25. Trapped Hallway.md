# Q25. Trapped Hallway

This T-shaped hallway has branches to the west, east, and south. Three arched windows in the north wall look out over the foggy grounds.

The ceiling in the hall is 20 feet high. The wooden doors to areas Q27 and Q28 are locked, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to break down. The 10-foot squares in front of the doors (marked T on the map) are trapped. When a character enters one of these squares, a floor-to-ceiling *wall of stone* (created by the spell of the same name) magically appears across the opening on the south wall. At the same time, the *phantom warriors* in areas Q27 and Q28 rush through the doors (which can be freely opened from their side) and attack.

The wall of stone vanishes after 10 minutes, at which time the trap resets. Characters who cast a *detect magic* spell in the hall can perceive hazy auras of evocation magic in front of the doors.
