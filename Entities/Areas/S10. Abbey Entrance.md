# S10. Abbey Entrance

A fifteen-foot-high curtain wall joins the abbey's two wings. Behind its battlements, two guards stand at attention, their features obscured by fog. Below them, set into the wall, is a pair of ten-foot-tall, wooden doors reinforced with bands of steel. To the right of these doors, mounted on the wall, is a tarnished copper plaque.

The plaque bears the abbey's name, under which appear these words: "May her light cure all illness."
The "guards" on the wall are propped-up scarecrows that wear corroded chain shirts and clutch rusted spears (see area S18). A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns the charade.

The double doors are heavy but unlocked. They can be pushed open to reveal a foggy courtyard (area S12).
