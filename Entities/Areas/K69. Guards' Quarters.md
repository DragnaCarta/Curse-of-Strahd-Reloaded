# K69. Guards' Quarters

Sickly, yellow lichen covers the ceiling of this cold, damp, ten-foot-wide passage running east and west. Opening off both sides of this passage are ten-foot-square alcoves that contain rotting cots, rags, and the skeletal remains of castle guards. A deathly silence fills the hall.

The yellow lichen is harmless. When one or more characters reach the midpoint of the hall, ten human skeletons leap from the alcoves and attack.
