# Q44. Dragon Gargoyle

Perched on the rooftop overlooking the parapet is a silver-plated gargoyle shaped like a dragon wyrmling.

The silver dragon wyrmling statue is 10 feet above the parapet and has a magic mouth spell cast on it. When a character passes in front of it, the spell is activated, and the wyrmling whispers the following short verse in the Common tongue:

When the dragon dreams its dream
Within its rightful tomb,
The light of Argynvost will beam
And rid this land of gloom.

An ancient ballista, rotted by time and weather, stands behind the battlements on this tower rooftop.

The ballista falls apart if disturbed.
