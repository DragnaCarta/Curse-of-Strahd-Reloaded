# B. Gates of Barovia 

Two sets of these gates exist: one west of the village of Barovia and one east of the village.

The fog spills out of the forest to swallow up the road behind you. Ahead, jutting from the impenetrable woods on both sides of the road, are high stone buttresses looming gray in the fog. Huge iron gates hang on the stonework. Dew clings with cold tenacity to the rusted bars. Two headless statues of armed guardians flank the gate, their heads now lying among the weeds at their feet. They greet you only with silence.

If the characters are traveling on foot, the gates swing open as they approach, screeching as the hinges move. The gates close behind the characters after they pass through. If the characters are riding in Vistani wagons, the gates open in front of the lead wagon and close when the rear one has entered.

The eastern gates don't open for people trying to leave Strahd's domain unless they are accompanied by Vistani. The fog chokes any non-Vistani that passes through the gates or skirts around them when they are closed (see "Mists of Ravenloft" earlier in this chapter).

If Strahd is defeated, the gates of Barovia swing open, and the road east becomes clear of fog.

## THE LANDS OF BAROVIA: COMMON FEATURES

Unless the text says otherwise, the following rules apply to doors, secret doors, locks, and webs in these lands.
Doors. A wooden door can be forced open with a successful DC 10 Strength check, or DC 15 if the door is barred or reinforced in some other manner. Increase the DC by 5 if the door is made of stone, or by 10 if it is made of iron. Decrease the DC by 5 if the door is made of glass or amber, or if the door is weakened in some manner (such as by rot or corrosion).

### Secret Doors. 
If there are obvious clues to a secret door's presence, such as scratch marks on a nearby wall or footprints leading to it, a character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher notices the secret door. Otherwise, finding a secret door requires a search of the area and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

### Locks. 
A creature proficient with thieves' tools can use them to pick a typical lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A typical padlock can be broken by smashing it with a bludgeoning or slashing weapon and succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check.

### Webs. 
Characters can pass through ordinary webs, including thick cobwebs, without fear of being restrained or slowed down. A character can clear away the cobwebs from a 10 -foot square as an action. Webs woven by giant spiders are a different matter; see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5 in the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on giant spider webs.
