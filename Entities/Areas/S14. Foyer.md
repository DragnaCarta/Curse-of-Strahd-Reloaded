# WotC source:
# S14. Foyer

This room used to be an office, as evidenced by the remains of a desk and a chair, both of which have been smashed to pieces. A hallway to the south leads to a staircase going up. A dark passage to the east is full of unnatural whispers, mad laughter, and bestial odors.

The stairs lead up to area S20.
If the characters enter this area making noise or carrying light sources, the golem in area S15 is drawn to them (unless they have already defeated it).
