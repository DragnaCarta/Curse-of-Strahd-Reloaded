# K62. Servants' Hall

This hall stands in deadly silence. Heavy beams support a sagging, ten-foot-high ceiling. Fog clings to the floor, obscuring everything that lies less than three feet above it. A giant shadow lurches across the ceiling as a dark figure shuffles purposefully down the corridor toward you.

The figure approaching is Cyrus Belview, a mongrelfolk (see appendix D) and Strahd's faithful servant. He stands 4 feet, 9 inches tall but appears shorter because of his hunched posture. He has the Keen Hearing and Smell feature. The left side his face is covered with lizard scales, and he has the ears of a panther. His left foot looks like a duck's webbed foot, and his arms have patches of black dog fur.

The light in the hall comes from a lantern on the floor behind Cyrus. If the characters have their own light sources, Cyrus sees them, but he will not attack first. He wears a loop of twine around his neck, hanging from which is an iron key and a decorative wooden pendant fitted with a varnished human eyeball. The key unlocks the iron chest in area K60. The wooden pendant is a hag eye given to Cyrus by the night hag Morgantha (see chapter 6), so that she could spy on Strahd. Cyrus doesn't know that the necklace is magical. See the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the hags entry in the Monster Manual for information about the hag eye.

CYRUS BELVIEW
Poor old Cyrus is obviously crazy. He has served the master for uncounted years and is devoted to him. Cyrus tries to get the characters to retire to their "room in the tower" (area K49). If the characters aren't sure what room he is talking about, he offers to lead them there.

If the characters follow Cyrus, he tells them to stay close to him as he leads them through the south door to area K61 and deliberately sets off the elevator trap there. Cyrus tries his best not to succumb to the sleeping gas as the elevator compartment climbs the shaft (area K31), and he has advantage on the saving throw. Assuming he's still conscious when the elevator compartment reaches the top of the shaft, Cyrus opens the trapdoor to area K47 and either leads the characters to area K49 or, if they're unconscious, drags them there. After assuring characters who are conscious that "the master will be along shortly," Cyrus then makes his way back downstairs to the kitchen (area K65).

If the characters don't go to their room, Cyrus shakes his head and returns to the work of preparing his dinner in area K65. If the characters take his key, he screams, "The master will not be pleased!" and begins to moan and slap his head, obviously upset. A successful DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check is enough to make him divulge the key's purpose, the location of the iron chest, and the chest's contents.

When he isn't being threatened, Cyrus giggles to himself from time to time for no clear reason. He also likes to tell poor jokes at the most inopportune moments.

Stairs at the east end of the north wall lead up to area K23.
Along the east wall is a rusted but sturdy iron portcullis that bars the way to area K63. (If the characters peer through the portcullis, read the boxed text for area K63.) The portcullis bars are 1 inch thick and spaced 4 inches apart. The portcullis can be lifted with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

The double doors at the west end of the hall are made of heavy planks banded with steel. They open into area K67.
