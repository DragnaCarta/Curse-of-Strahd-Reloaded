# Q21. North Alcove

A red velvet curtain hangs in front of an alcove in the northeast corner of this hall.

The alcove is empty except for the narrow windows in the back walls. Whenever the characters part the curtain and leave, the curtain is closed when they return. Only by removing the curtain from its rod can they prevent the curtain from closing on its own.
