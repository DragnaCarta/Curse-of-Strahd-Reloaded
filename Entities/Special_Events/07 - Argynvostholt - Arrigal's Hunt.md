# **Arrigal's Hunt**

Ezmerelda d'Avenir (see appendix D) arrives at Argynvostholt on the back of a riding horse stolen from the Vistani camp outside Vallaki (chapter 5, area N9). She has heard that the reportedly haunted mansion might harbor enemies of Strahd and contain secrets to the vampire's destruction.

Once she arrives, Ezmerelda releases the horse (which flees back to its camp) and quietly makes her way through the mansion until she reaches the characters.

Hot on Ezmerelda's trail are the Vistani leader Arrigal (NE male human assassin) and two Vistani bodyguards (CE female bandits). Arrigal rides a black riding horse, while the bandits ride two dire wolves. These dire wolves are servants of Strahd and can't be charmed or frightened.

Arrigal is determined to capture Ezmerelda and haul her back to the Vistani camp to face punishment for horse theft. He does nothing to antagonize the characters, however, and returns to the Vistani camp if he can't convince them to give up Ezmerelda. For more information on Arrigal, see chapter 5, area N9c.
