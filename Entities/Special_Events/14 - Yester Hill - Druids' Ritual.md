# Druids' Ritual

You can allow this event to unfold regardless of whether the characters have visited Yester Hill. Even if the characters don't experience this event as it happens, they can still deal with the aftermath (see "Wintersplinter Attacks" in the "Special Events" section in chapter 12).

Strahd travels to Yester Hill, arriving astride his nightmare, Beucephalus (assuming the characters didn't kill it in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft), or in bat form.

Strahd's arrival prompts the druids in area Y3 to rise from their "graves" and begin their ritual. When the ritual begins, the druids use their actions to chant and dance about. To complete the ritual, the druids must chant for 10 consecutive rounds, with at least one of them chanting each round. If a round goes

by and none of the druids are able to chant on their turn, the ritual is ruined and must be started anew. If the Gulthias tree (area Y4) has been reduced to 0 hit points, the ritual won't work. Druids who realize that the tree has been destroyed know enough not to attempt the ritual.

Strahd observes the proceedings, defending the druids if they are attacked and retreating if outmatched.

## Development 

If the characters are present when the druids complete the ritual, read:

A thirty-foot-tall plant creature bursts out of the statue, sending twigs and earth flying. The creature resembles a dead treant with green light seeping out of it.

The creature that erupts from the wooden statue is a tree blight (see appendix D) that the druids call Winter Splinter. The green light comes from the magic gem embedded in its "heart." The gem can be removed only when Winter splinter is dead.

The druids command Winter splinter to travel north and lay waste to the Wizard of Wines vineyard (chapter 12). Although the characters might not understand what the druids are up to, they will no doubt wonder where the druids are sending the tree blight. As Winter splinter travels north, its destination should become clear to characters who have previously visited the winery and the vineyard. Whether they try to halt its advance is up to them.

Once the tree blight departs, Strahd commands the druids and berserkers to leave the hill so that he can be alone. As they flee into the woods, he gazes longingly at the image of his ancestral homeland to the west (see area Y5).
