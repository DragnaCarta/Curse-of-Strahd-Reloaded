This event can occur if the characters don't or can't raise the burgomaster's son, Ilya, from the dead.
If alive, the Abbot learns that Ilya died recently and, in his human guise, visits the burgomaster's cottage. If one or more characters are staying there, they hear a knock at the door. Without bothering to introduce himself, the Abbot tells the burgomaster and his wife that he wants to raise their son from the dead. He claims that the "gods of light" want the Krezkov bloodline restored.

The characters can try to interfere in the raising of Ilya Krezkov. Otherwise, the burgomaster digs up his son's corpse. Without needing the requisite material components, the Abbot casts a raise dead, returning Ilya to life with 1 hit point. Anna Krezkova praises the Abbot and Saint Markovia for this generous act before tending to her son. The burgomaster, his grief dispelled, fears that he has misjudged the Abbot and has no way to repay him for this supreme act of kindness.

## Development

Ilya Krezkov returns to life with a random form of indefinite madness (see "Madness Effects" in chapter 8, "Running the Game," of the Dungeon Master's Guide). The Abbot uses the raising of Ilya as leverage to get the burgomaster to undertake an unusual quest (see "Something Borrowed" below).
