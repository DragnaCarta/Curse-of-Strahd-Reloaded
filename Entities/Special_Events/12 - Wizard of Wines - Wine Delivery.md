# Wine Delivery

After restoring the Martikovs to their rightful positions, the characters might ask them to deliver wine to the Blue Water Inn (chapter 5, area N2), the Vistani in the camp outside Vallaki (chapter 5, area N9), or the burgomaster of Krezk (chapter 8, area S2). A grateful Davian sets his sons to the task immediately. [[Adrian Martikov]] brings the three remaining wine barrels up from the cellar and sets them on the wagon while [[Elvir Martikov]] secures the horses. Adrian and Elvir make the delivery themselves, but they welcome the party's escort. If the characters don't volunteer for guard duty, [[Davian Martikov]] suggests they go along with the wine wagon to ensure its safety.

If the characters escort the wagon, check for a random encounter once for each mile traveled. The wagon is also watched over by two swarms of ravens that swoop down to attack anything that threatens the wagon or the characters.

## Development

The characters can trade the six barrels of wine for a much-needed treasure in the possession of the Keepers of the Feather or the Vistani (see chapter 5, areas N2q and N9i), or they can use it to buy their way into the walled village of Krezk (chapter 8).
