# Wintersplinter Attacks

If the characters leave the winery and return at a later time before dealing with Wintersplinter (see the "Druids' Ritual" section in chapter 14), the enormous tree blight (see appendix D) is sent from Yester Hill to ravage the vineyard and destroy the winery.

The characters arrive to find the grapevines trampled and the winery in ruins. Wintersplinter's tracks are clearly visible on the trail to the south. Characters who follow the tracks catch up with Wintersplinter as the blight slowly makes its way back to Yester Hill.

The Martikovs narrowly escape the carnage and flee to the Blue Water Inn in Vallaki (chapter 5, area N2). [[Davian Martikov]] is crushed by the loss of the winery, and morale in Vallaki sinks to an all-time low as word of the winery's destruction spreads through town.

## Development 

Three days after Wintersplinter's attack, Baba Lysaga (see chapter 10, area U3) dispatches the seven scarecrows from Berez and orders them to take up positions in the vineyard, to discourage the wereravens from returning. These scarecrows attack anyone who crosses the vineyard or approaches the ruined winery.
