# Roc of Mount Ghakis

As the characters cross the stone bridge (area T8) from east to west - possibly on their way back from the Amber Temple (chapter 13) - they are spotted by a roc that has survived in the mountains for thousands of years. The roc has a great nest on the top of Mount Ghakis to the southeast and feeds on fish in the nearby lake.

When the Roc of Mount Ghakis appears, read:

%% --- Page 219 --- %%
Diving toward the bridge is a creature of unearthly size - a bird so monstrous that its wings blot out the sky.

The roc attacks a random creature on the bridge, snatching up a horse or a mule, if one is available. Otherwise, it attacks a party member. It can't reach characters who hide in the guard posts at either end of the bridge. If it has nothing to attack on its turn, the roc lets loose a horrible shriek and flies back to its nest.
