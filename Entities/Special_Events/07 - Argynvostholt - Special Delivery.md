This encounter occurs while the characters are inside Argynvostholt. Those who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher hear the clopping of horse hooves and the crunch of wagon wheels on gravel.

A cart pulled by a draft horse and driven by a mad Vistana named Kolya (CN male human bandit) stops in front of the mansion. After relieving himself on the statue of Argynvost (area Q1), Kolya untethers the horse and rides back to the Vistani camp outside Vallaki (chapter 5, area N9), leaving the cart and its cargo: a plain wooden coffin.

The coffin was made in Vallaki by the local coffin maker, Henrik van der Voort (see chapter 5, area N6). It has the name of one of the characters (determined randomly) neatly chiseled into its lid. Opening the coffin releases a swarm of bats from within. The swarm attacks the character whose name is engraved on the coffin. If that character isn't in sight, the swarm flies away.
