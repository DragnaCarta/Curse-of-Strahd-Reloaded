  <p><strong><em>Phantasmal Force.</em></strong> Vilnius casts <em>phantasmal force</em>. A creature that fails its saving throw against the spell can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.</p>

  <h3>Reactions</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Illusionist’s Trick.</em></strong> <em>Trigger:</em> A creature attacks or casts a spell targeting Vilnius, one of his allies, or an illusion resembling them. <em>Response:</em> If the target is an illusion identical to one of Vilnius’s allies, or an ally identical to one of his illusions, the two swap places, as though teleported by a <em>misty step</em> spell.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Horrifying Visage (1/Day).</em></strong> <em>Trigger:</em> Vilnius takes damage from a creature he can see. <em>Effect:</em> Each non-undead creature of Vilnius’s choice within <span class="highlight">30 feet</span> must make a <span class="highlight">DC 16 Wisdom saving throw</span> or be <span class="highlight">frightened</span> for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
