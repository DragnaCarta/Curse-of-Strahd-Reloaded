[[Non-Player Characters#Davian Martikov]]
* **Davian** is the patriarch of the Martikov family and the widower of his late wife, Mirabel Oraonova. Publicly, he avows that Elric was a fool, insubordinate, and disobedient for refusing Davian’s command to stay away from Castle Ravenloft. Deep down, Davian is shattered that the last words he spoke to his son before Elric’s death were, “*And don’t come back!*" Davian most often feels annoyed, irritated, satisfied, or grumpy, and should make the players feel insulted, grateful, and sympathetic to him.
