[[Non-Player Characters]]
# Morgantha, Dream Peddler
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** At the time the players meet her, Morgantha should inspire flattery and comfort with her grandmotherly charm, gratitude for her willingness to share compliments and "free samples," endearment for her complaints about the mundane trials of an old woman's life, and slight wariness of her confidence and comfort traveling alone on a dangerous road.

***Emotions.*** Morgantha most often appears to feel cheerful, amused, or thoughtful.

 ***Motivations.*** Morgantha wants to keep her cover, keep her business operating peacefully, make strangers feel endeared to and comfortable with her, and encourage others to try her dream pastries if they appear inclined to do so.

 ***Inspirations.*** Granny Weatherwax (*Discworld*), Minerva McGonagall (*Harry Potter*), Dr. Kureha (*One Piece*)
 
 **Character Information**
 ***Persona.*** To the world, Morgantha is a cheerful old lady with a love for gossip and complaining. Only Morgantha and her daughters know that she is secretly the black-hearted matron of a night hag coven.

 ***Morale.*** In a fight, Morgantha would attempt to parlay for peace, then use her ***etherealness*** ability to escape into the Ethereal Plane if doing so appears fruitless.

 ***Relationships.*** Morgantha is the mother of the **night hags** Bella and Offalia, and the dream-pastry dealer for the Barovian refugee [[Arc H - The Lost Soul#H3b. Franz’s Tent|Franz]].

<p><strong><em>Hag Coven.</em></strong> The coven includes three hags: Morgantha, Bella, and Offalia. A hag acts on her own initiative, keeps concentration and suffers conditions independently, and has her own action, bonus action, reaction, and movement. Any damage a hag takes is subtracted from the coven's hit points. (If multiple hags take damage from the same source, the coven loses hit points that many times.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Close Quarters Fighter.</em></strong> The coven doesn't have disadvantage on their ranged attack rolls when within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The coven has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spellcasting.</em></strong> The coven's spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks).
<p><strong><em>Complex Casting.</em></strong> If a hag casts a spell on her turn using a bonus action, she can also use her action to cast a non-cantrip spell on the same turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Second Phase.</em></strong> If the coven is reduced to 0 hit points, its statistics are instantly replaced by those of **The Nightmare Three**. Its initiative remains the same. Excess damage doesn't carry over to its new form, but it retains any conditions it had in its previous form.</p>

<p><strong><em>Maniacal Mirth (Offalia Only).</em></strong> <em>1st-level enchantment</em>, 30 feet, components V S M, instantaneous. <em>Effect:</em> In response to taking damage from a creature that Offalia can see within range, Offalia can use her reaction to force that creature to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw.

On a failure, the beam forms an arc of lightning connecting Morgantha to the attacker until the start of its next turn. While the arc lasts, Morgantha has resistance to all damage, and each time she takes damage, the connected creature takes the same amount of damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Misty Step (Any).</em></strong> In response to taking damage, a hag can use her reaction to cast <em>misty step</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hag Coven.</em></strong> The coven includes three hags: Morgantha, Bella, and Offalia. If the coven is reduced to 0 hit points, all hags die. Until then, a hag acts on her own initiative, suffers conditions independently, and has her own action, bonus action, reaction, and movement. Any damage a hag takes is subtracted from the coven's hit points.</p>
<p><strong><em>Nightmare Forms.</em></strong> In this phase, Bella assumes the form of a Huge crocodile, Offalia assumes the form of a Huge elephant, and Morgantha is surrounded by a shroud of swirling shadows.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The coven has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Charge (Offalia Only).</em></strong> If Offalia moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 11 (2d10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Bite (Bella Only).</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and Bella can't bite another target.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail (Bella Only).</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target not grappled by Bella. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gore (Offalia Only).</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (2d8 +5) piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Eyebite (Morgantha Only).</em></strong> Morgantha casts or uses <em>eyebite</em> (DC 17). A target that succeeds on the saving throw is dazed instead until the end of its next turn. (A dazed creature can move or take one action on its turn, not both. It also can’t take a bonus action or a reaction.)</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Tail Swipe (Bella Only).</em></strong> Bella swipes her tail in a 10-foot cone. Each creature within that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage and falling prone on a failure. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hallucinatory Mist (Bella Only).</em></strong> Bella sprays a 30-foot cone of pearlescent mist. Each creature within the mist must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be dazed until the start of Bella's next turn. (A dazed creature can move or take one action on its turn, not both. It also can’t take a bonus action or a reaction.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Stomp (Offalia Only).</em></strong> Offalia stomps the ground around her. Each creature within a 5-foot radius must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage on a failure and half as much damage on a success.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fiend's Trumpet (Offalia Only).</em></strong> Offalia releases a sonorous, low-pitched trumpet from her trunk. Each humanoid creature within a 60-foot radius must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or subtract 1d4 from their next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.</p>
<p><strong><em>Enervating Ring (Morgantha Only).</em></strong> Tendrils of inky darkness reach out from Morgantha, touching each creature within a 10-foot radius. Each target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) necrotic damage and be slowed until the end of its next turn. (A slowed creature must spend 1 extra foot of movement for every foot it moves using its speed, attack rolls against it have advantage, and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Inflict Nightmares (Morgantha Only).</em></strong> Morgantha conjures a cloud of ethereal mist around a creature she can see within 30 feet, forcing it to succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until it takes damage or another creature uses its action to shake them awake. The creature takes 9 (2d8) psychic damage at the end of its turn if it's still stunned.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>

<p><strong><em>Absorb Elements (Any).</em></strong> In response to taking acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, the hag uses her reaction to cast <em>absorb elements</em>.</p>
