[[Vallakovich Manor]]
# Izek Strazni
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Izek should inspire disgust with his cruelty and indifference to human life, and discomfort with his unnerving interest in Ireena Kolyana.

***Emotions.*** Izek most often feels irritated, enraged, impatient, sadistic, obsessed, or bored.

***Motivations.*** Izek wants to serve the Baron faithfully—and, far more importantly, find and possess the woman he's been dreaming of.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Izek, channel Ser Gregor Clegane (Game of Thrones), Fenrir Greyback (Harry Potter), and Kratos (God of War).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Izek is a cruel and brutish enforcer with a love for fire and blood.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Izek would gladly draw his silvered battleaxe and fight to the death.

***Relationships.*** Izek is the adoptive "son" of Baron Vargas Vallakovich, the captain of Vallaki's town guard, a frequent customer of the toymaker Gadof Blinsky, and (unbeknownst to either of them) the biological brother of Ireena Kolyana.

<p><strong><em>Close Quarters Fighter.</em></strong> Izek doesn't have disadvantage on his ranged attack rolls when within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Second Phase.</em></strong> When Izek is reduced to 0 hit points, his arms and axe are engulfed in flames, the barbs on his fiendish arm grow longer and sharper, and his skin grows red and begins to smoke. His statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of his second form. His initiative count doesn’t change. Excess damage doesn't carry over to his new form, but he retains any conditions he had in his previous form.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Izek makes two attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Silvered Battleaxe.</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage and Izek can push the target up to 5 ft. away.</p>
<p><strong><em>Flame Hurl.</em></strong> <em>Ranged spell attack:</em> +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (2d6) fire damage.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Slicing Whirl.</em></strong> Izek whirls his battleaxe around him. Each creature within a 5-foot radius must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (2d4) slashing damage and fall prone. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage and doesn’t fall prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Flame Volley.</em></strong> Izek conjures a volley of fiery orbs that rain down on a point within 60 ft. that he can see. Each creature within 10 ft. of that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Izek can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent him from taking reactions, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Izek can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting him. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Forceful Retreat.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack, Izek makes a shove attack against the attacker. He can then immediately move up to 15 ft. away from the attacker without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vengeful Strike.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Izek can move up to 15 ft. toward the attacker without provoking opportunity attacks. He can then immediately make an attack against that creature with his battleaxe.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Izek makes two melee attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Silvered Battleaxe.</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Burning Punch.</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage, and Izek can push the target up to 5 ft. away. On a critical hit, the target must also succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be dazed until the start of Izek’s next turn. (That creature can move or take one action on its turn, not both. It also can’t take a bonus action or a reaction.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Flaming Wave.</em></strong> A wave of flames sweeps out from Izek in a line that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) fire damage. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Flame Burst.</em></strong> Izek slams his battleaxe into the ground, causing a torrent of flames to swirl around him. Each creature within 5 feet must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Explosive Blast.</em></strong> A bright streak flashes from Izek’s clawed hand to a point he chooses within 90 feet and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target that fails the save is also knocked prone. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Izek can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent him from taking reactions, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Izek can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting him. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Hot Pursuit.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Izek propels himself forward with a jet of crackling flames, moving up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. He can then immediately make a <strong><em>burning punch</em></strong> attack against a creature within range.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cinder Sparks.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack, Izek causes the air around him to burst with swirling cinders. The attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) fire damage and be blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Retaliatory Burn (1/round).</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack made with a metal weapon, Izek causes the object to glow red-hot until the start of his next turn. Any creature in physical contact with the weapon immediately takes 4 (1d8) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or drop the weapon if it can. If it doesn’t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of Izek’s next turn.</p>
