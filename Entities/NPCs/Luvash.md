# Luvash
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Luvash should make the players feel sympathetic to his grief, endeared to his dedication to his daughter, irritated with his stubbornness, and mildly uncomfortable with his hot temper.

***Emotions.*** Luvash most often feels angered, melancholy, anxious, guilty, desperate, frustrated, joyful, content, amused, or grateful.

***Motivations.*** Luvash wants to ensure that his daughter, Arabelle, is safe and loved, and that the families of the Vistani encampment can thrive and prosper.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Luvash, channel Boromir (*The Lord of the Rings*), Robert Baratheon (*A Game of Thrones*), Bob Parr (*The Incredibles*), and Wolverine (*X-Men*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Luvash is a gruff, stubborn brawler with an impatient spirit and a heart of gold. To those he trusts, Luvash is a fiercely devoted father with a soft and gentle compassion—but near-overwhelmed by anxiety for the safety of his daughter.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Luvash would draw his blade to protect his people without a moment’s hesitation, but would swiftly sheathe it if necessary to keep Arabelle safe.

***Relationships.*** Luvash is the elder brother of Arrigal, one of Strahd’s spies. (Luvash doesn’t know that Arrigal is a spy for Strahd.) Luvash is also the father of Arabelle, whose mother was one of Madam Eva’s descendants, and—along with Arrigal—one of the two leaders of the Vistani camp outside of Vallaki.# WotC source:
