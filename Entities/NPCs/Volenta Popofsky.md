# WotC source:
[[Non-Player Characters]]
# Volenta Popofsky
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Volenta should inspire revulsion with her obsession with pain and gore, discomfort with her sadistic and psychotic personality, and a strange sort of flattery with her flirtatious—if eccentric—attitude.

***Emotions.*** Volenta most often feels amused, curious, irritated, bored, fascinated, enraged, and gleeful.

***Motivations.*** Volenta wants to impress Strahd and earn her place as foremost among his brides, to satisfy her frequent sadistic urges, and to find novel ways to cause suffering and pain through tinkering and innovation.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Volenta, channel Jinx (*Arcane*), Ty Lee (*Avatar: The Last Airbender*), and Harley Quinn (*Batman*).

**Character Information**

***Persona.*** To strangers, Volenta is a manic, impulsive, and trigger-happy sadist with a flair for invention and innovation.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Volenta would gleefully relish the opportunity to test her custom-made weapons on hostile subjects—and, when pushed far enough, to tear those subjects apart with her bare hands and teeth.

***Relationships.*** Volenta is fanatically loyal to [[Strahd von Zarovich]], and views his other brides and consorts—especially Anastrasya, Ludmilla, and Escher—with deep resentment, jealousy, and suspicion.

<p><strong><em>Close Quarters Fighter.</em></strong> Volenta doesn't have disadvantage on her ranged attack rolls when within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Volenta regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If Volenta takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> Volenta can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight, Volenta takes 20 radiant damage at the start of her turn, and she has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Nimble Escape.</em></strong> Volenta can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of her turns.</p>
<p><strong><em>Awakened Bloodlust.</em></strong> When Volenta drops to 0 hit points, her statistics are instantly replaced by the statistics of her second form. Her initiative count doesn't change. Excess damage doesn't carry over to her new form, but she retains any conditions she had in her previous form.</p>
<div class="break"></div>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Volenta uses <strong><em>hail of daggers</em></strong> twice, <strong><em>dagger</em></strong> twice, or <strong><em>hail of daggers</em></strong> once and either <strong><em>tanglefoot</em></strong> or <strong><em>thunderstone</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hail of Daggers.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, range 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dagger.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em> +7 to hit, 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tanglefoot (1/day).</em></strong> Volenta hurls a bag of writhing, sticky black tar at a point on the ground within 30 feet. The bag bursts on impact, covering up to two creatures within 5 feet of one another with sticky tar and forcing each target to succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be restrained. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thunderstone (1/day).</em></strong> Volenta hurls a crystalline shard at a creature, object, or surface within 30 feet. The shard shatters on impact with a blast of concussive energy. Each creature within 10 feet of the point of impact must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed 10 feet away from that point. A creature that fails the save is also deafened until the start of Volenta’s next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alchemist's Firebomb (1/day).</em></strong> Volenta hurls a flask of concentrated alchemist's fire at a point within 30 feet. The vial shatters on impact and detonates in a 10-foot radius. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage and be set ablaze. A creature set ablaze in this way takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns, and can make an additional DC 14 Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns to extinguish the flames.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Smokestick (1/day).</em></strong> When Volenta is reduced to 0 hit points, if she isn't grappled, restrained, or incapacitated, she can crack a charred, black wooden stick, releasing a cloud of thick, opaque smoke that creates a heavily obscured area in a 20-foot radius. She can then move up to her speed without triggering opportunity attacks. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.

<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Volenta regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water.

<p><strong><em>Blood Frenzy.</em></strong> Volenta has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Volenta makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by Volenta, incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Volenta regains hit points equal to that amount. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. Each time the target finishes a long rest without being bitten again, it can roll one of its hit dice and add its Constitution modifier. The target’s maximum hit points increase by an amount equal to the result. (This increase can’t raise the target’s hit points above its original maximum.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, Volenta can grapple the target (escape DC 13).</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Leap.</em></strong> Volenta moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks. As she does, she can replace 10 feet of movement with a 10-foot high jump.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dislocate.</em></strong> Volenta dislocates her joints, automatically escaping any nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has her grappled.
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Volenta can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Volenta would lose her reactions, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spit Blood.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack, Volenta spits a wad of blood at the attacking creature’s eyes, forcing it to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aggress.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Volenta moves up to her speed toward a hostile creature she can see without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Abscond.</em></strong> In response to escaping a grapple, Volenta uses her <strong><em>leap</em></strong> feature.

<p><strong><em>Hail of Daggers.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, range 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thunderstone (2/day).</em></strong> Volenta hurls a crystalline shard at a creature, object, or surface within 30 feet. The shard shatters on impact with a blast of concussive energy. Each creature within 10 feet of the point of impact must succeed on a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Constitution saving throw</span> or be knocked prone and pushed 10 feet away from that point. A creature that fails the save is also deafened until the start of Volenta's next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Froststar (3/day).</em></strong> Volenta throws a crystalline shard at a point she can see within 30 feet. The shard explodes on impact, covering the area with thick, icy frost. Each creature within 5 feet of the point of impact must make a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Dexterity saving throw</span>. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 cold damage and is restrained by ice until the start of Volenta's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn't restrained. A restrained creature can use its action to make a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Strength check</span> to break free. A 5-foot-square section of ice has AC 10, 15 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning and fire damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage.</p>

<p>Volenta can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Volenta would lose her reactions, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Conflagration.</em></strong> When Volenta is reduced to 0 hit points, she can use her alchemist's firebomb if available, centered on herself. (Any damage taken doesn’t carry over to her second form.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Acrobatic Escape.</em></strong> When an attack misses Volenta, she can use her reaction to move up to half her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Caustic Splash (1/day).</em></strong> When Volenta takes damage from a creature within 5 feet of her, she can use her reaction to splash that creature with caustic chemicals.
