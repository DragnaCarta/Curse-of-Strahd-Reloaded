<p><strong><em>Incorporeal Movement.</em></strong> Varushka can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. She takes 5 (1d10) force damage if she ends her turn inside an object.
<p><strong><em>Overwhelming Despair.</em></strong> When Varushka drops to 0 hit points, her sclera darken and a shroud of swirling mist and whispering shadows surrounds her. Her statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of her second form. Her initiative count doesn't change. Excess damage doesn't carry over to her new form, but she retains any conditions she had in her previous form.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Varushka uses <strong><em>warp flesh</em></strong> twice. She can replace one or both with <strong><em>animate minor object.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Animate Minor Object.</em></strong> Varushka animates an undamaged Small or Medium object she can see within 30 feet for 1 minute or until the object is destroyed. The object becomes an <strong>animated minor object</strong> (see below). It acts on Varushka’s initiative, but takes its turn immediately after hers</p>
<p><strong><em>Animate Major Object (1/day).</em></strong> Varushka animates an undamaged Large object she can see within 30 feet for 1 minute or until the object is destroyed. The object becomes an <strong>animated major object</strong> (see below). It acts on Varushka’s initiative, but takes its turn immediately after hers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Warp Flesh.</em></strong> Varushka forces one creature she can see within 30 feet to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 12 (2d8 + 3) necrotic damage and Varushka can cause its arms or legs to warp grotesquely until the start of her next turn. (A creature with warped arms can’t crawl, makes weapon attacks with disadvantage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw each time it attempts to cast a spell with somatic components or lose the spell. A creature with warped legs falls prone.)</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Stonemelt.</em></strong> Varushka turns the floor around her within 5 feet into quicksand (Dungeon Master’s Guide, p. 110) for 1 minute. A 5-foot square area turned into quicksand in this way immediately ceases to be quicksand if no creature is sunk into it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Papercut.</em></strong> Varushka tears the pages from the books in the Lounge and creates a whirlwind of slicing paper centered on a point she can see within 30 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius, 15-foot-tall cylinder centered on that point must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horrific Visage (1/day).</em></strong> Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of Varushka that can see her must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of Varushka’s next turn. If a target’s save fails by 5 or more, the target is also turned while frightened in this way. (A turned creature must take the Dash action and move away from the source of its fear by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move.)</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Varushka can take up to three reactions per round, though no more than one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent her from taking reactions, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Varushka can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting her. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Swap.</em></strong> In response to being targeted by an attack or spell, or by being placed in a spell’s area of effect, Varushka forces a creature she can see within 30 feet other than the attacker or caster to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, she and the target switch places, and the target suffers the effects of the attack or spell instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Adhere.</em></strong> In response to being missed by a melee attack, Varushka forces the creature to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the weapon or limb used in the attack is adhered to a nearby surface until the start of Varushka’s next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Erupt (1/day).</em></strong> In response to being reduced to 0 hit points, Varushka forces each creature within 30 feet to succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or take 11 (2d10) force damage and be pushed 20 feet away. If the target can’t move the full distance, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 5 feet not moved and falls prone.</p>

<p><strong><em>Close Quarters Fighter.</em></strong> Varushka doesn't have disadvantage on her ranged attack rolls when within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Incorporeal Movement.</em></strong> Varushka can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. She takes 5 (1d10) force damage if she ends her turn inside an object.
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Varushka makes two attacks with her <strong><em>life drain</em></strong> and/or <strong><em>mist garrote</em></strong> attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Life Drain.</em></strong>  <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage and Varushka forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target falls prone and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mist Garrotte.</em></strong>  <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, range 30 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or rise vertically 10 feet and remain suspended there until the start of Varushka’s next turn. While suspended, the target’s speed is 0 and it can’t speak or cast a spell that includes a verbal component.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Vampiric Mist.</em></strong> Tendrils of blood-red mist extrude from Varushka, touching each creature within 5 feet of her. A target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) necrotic damage and have disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the start of Varushka’s next turn. Varushka regains hit points equal to half the damage taken (rounded up), and the target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dark Whispers.</em></strong> Dissonant, mournful whispers fill the air around Varushka, forcing each creature within 30 feet to succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 3 (1d6) psychic damage and gain disadvantage on the first attack roll or saving throw it makes before the start of Varushka’s next turn.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Varushka can take up to three reactions per round, though no more than one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent her from taking reactions, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Varushka can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting her. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Misty Step.</em></strong> In response to taking damage, Varushka teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space. She can then immediately make a <strong><em>life drain</em></strong> attack against a creature within reach.
<p><strong><em>Calming Whispers.</em></strong> In response to a creature that she can see within 10 feet targeting her with an attack or spell, Varushka forces that creature to succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 5 (2d4) psychic damage and gains one level of exhaustion for the next minute. If the creature wasn’t already exhausted, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns except this one, decreasing its exhaustion by one level on a success.
