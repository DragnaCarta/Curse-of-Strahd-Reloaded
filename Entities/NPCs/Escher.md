# Escher
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Escher should make the players feel amused and flattered with his flamboyantly flirtatious behavior, irritated with his snide or condescending commentary, and, eventually, sympathetic to his unspoken guilt for his role in bringing harm to his friends and neighbors by awakening Strahd.

***Emotions.*** Escher most often feels annoyed, curious, angry, smug, anxious, fearful, playful, mischievous, amused, guilty, bitter, regretful, or ashamed.

***Motivations.*** Escher wants to please Strahd and avoid falling from his favor.

***Inspirations.*** When roleplaying Escher, channel Astarion (*Baldur's Gate 3*), Crowley (*Good Omens*), and Renly Baratheon (*Game of Thrones*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Escher is a flamboyant and self-assured member of Strahd's court, with a love for preening, luxuries, and attention. Only Escher knows that he is a guilt-ridden, self-loathing, broken man who longs desperately for Strahd's approval and has long since resigned himself to the cage his choices have trapped him in.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Escher would seek to entreat or flee his adversary, fighting only if cornered or if grievously offended.

***Relationships.*** Before becoming one of Strahd's consorts, Escher had a crush on Doru, his former best friend. He is now one of Strahd's consorts—though not formally wed to him—and an inferior member of Strahd's court.
