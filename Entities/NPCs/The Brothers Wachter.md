[[Non-Player Characters]]
# The Brothers Wachter
## Nikolai Wachter
### **Personality**

- Always _talking_, always _exaggerating_, always _puffing himself up.
- Makes threats he absolutely does not intend to follow through on.
- Snickers at his own jokes.
- Loves impressing strangers; hates being ignored.
### **Behavioral Notes**

- Hovering, swaggering, peacocking.
- Hands always in motion: fiddling with his cloak, his hair, a stolen trinket.
- Breaks eye contact as soon as someone calls his bluff.
### **Emotional Pressure Points**

- Insecure about being the “heir” to nothing of value.
- Deep fear of his mother’s cold disappointment.
- Desperate to be seen as dangerous or important.
### **How He Treats the PCs**

- **Arden:** A mix of fear and fascination. Calls Arden “dark elf” or “knight” interchangeably because he can’t decide which is cooler.
- **Fig:** Thinks Fig is “hilarious,” the way rich jerks find circus performers hilarious. Gets visibly nervous when Fig moves too fast.
- **Choppy:** Low-key intimidated by Choppy’s “sorcerous” aura but pretends not to be. Calls magic “cheating.”
- **Varnish:** Polarized reactions. Sometimes forgets he exists; sometimes treats him like a curiosity. He understands nothing about bards.

## Karl Wachter
### **Personality**

- Withdrawn, sardonic, sharp-eyed.
- Speaks less, but when he talks, it _hurts._
- More wounded than wicked.
- Shows signs of having read one (1) book and letting it change him completely.
### **Behavioral Notes**

- Leans against walls; fades into shadows.
- Laughs softly at Nikolai’s failures more than at jokes.
- Watches everyone with a predator’s stillness, but not a predator’s intent.

### **Emotional Pressure Points**

- Secret guilt about the Wachter cult business—he knows it’s wrong but thinks resistance is pointless.
- Feels overshadowed by Nikolai despite being smarter.
- Quietly yearns for someone to treat him as a human, not an accessory to his mother.

### **How He Treats the PCs**

- **Arden:** Studies him like an animal watching a thunderstorm. Respects strength but says nothing.
- **Fig:** Mild respect; Fig’s discipline is alien to him.
- **Choppy:** Will absolutely ask Choppy uncomfortable questions about magic.
- **Varnish:** Karl sees right through Varnish in a weird, unsettling way—something about the bardic facade intrigues him.
