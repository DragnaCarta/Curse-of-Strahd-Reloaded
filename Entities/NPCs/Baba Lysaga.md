  <p><strong><em>Blessing of Mother Night.</em></strong> Baba Lysaga is shielded against divination magic, as though protected by a <em>nondetection</em> spell.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Skilled Casting.</em></strong> Baba Lysaga can concentrate on up to three spells at a time. If she would lose concentration on one, she loses concentration on all of them.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Flying Skull.</em></strong> While riding her flying giant’s skull, Baba Lysaga gains a fly speed of 30 ft. and has half cover. The skull shares Baba Lysaga’s Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores and saving throws, and is otherwise as described in <span class="citation">U3. Baba Lysaga’s Hut (p. 163)</span>.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Swallowed by the Swamp.</em></strong> When Baba Lysaga is reduced to 0 hit points, she plunges or sinks into the swamp of Berez. She then resurfaces, riding atop a tower of swamp vines coiled around her lower body. Her statistics are instantly replaced by those of her second form. Her initiative count doesn’t change, excess damage doesn’t carry over, and she retains none of the conditions she had in her previous form.</p>
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Baba Lysaga uses Hair Blade twice, or uses Spellcasting to cast <em>acid splash</em> twice.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Hair Blades.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: <span class="highlight">9 (1d8 + 5)</span> slashing plus <span class="highlight">4 (1d8)</span> poison damage, and the target must succeed on a <span class="highlight">DC 17 Constitution saving throw</span> or be <span class="highlight">poisoned</span> for 1 minute or until it receives magical healing. A creature poisoned in this way must make a <span class="highlight">DC 17 Constitution saving throw</span> at the end of each of its turns. Each time it fails, it becomes <span class="highlight">slowed</span> if it is currently poisoned, or becomes <span class="highlight">paralyzed</span> if it is currently slowed. Each time it succeeds, it becomes slowed if it is currently paralyzed, becomes poisoned if it is currently slowed, or is no longer poisoned if it is currently poisoned. If the creature rolls a natural 20, it’s no longer poisoned.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Spellcasting.</em></strong> Baba Lysaga casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks):<br>
  <em>At will</em>: acid splash (3d6 damage), mage hand, detect magic, magic missile (level 2 version), sleep (level 2 version), lightning bolt<br>
  <em>3/day each</em>: Evard’s black tentacles, polymorph<br>
  <em>1/day each</em>: scrying, programmed illusion, mirage arcane</p>
  <p><strong><em>Devouring Flies.</em></strong> Swarming flies fill a <span class="highlight">10-foot-radius</span> sphere centered on a point Baba Lysaga can see within 60 feet. Each creature within the sphere must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking <span class="highlight">11 (2d10)</span> piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Whether a creature succeeds or fails its Constitution saving throw, any spells of 3rd level or lower on that creature end. If a creature is concentrating on a spell that would be dispelled in this way, it can use its reaction to spend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. If it does, the spell doesn’t end.</p>
  <h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Swarm.</em></strong> Baba Lysaga magically polymorphs into a <strong>swarm of insects</strong> (flies), flies up to 30 ft., then resumes her true form. Anything she is wearing or carrying transforms with her. While transformed, melee weapon attacks against her have <span class="highlight">disadvantage</span>.</p>
  <h3>Reactions</h3>
  <p>Baba Lysaga can take up to five reactions per round, but only one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent her from taking reactions, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Baba Lysaga can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting her. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require her to fail a saving throw.)</p>
  <p><strong><em>Parry.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> Baba Lysaga is hit by a melee attack roll. <strong>Effect:</strong> Baba Lysaga’s bladed hair braids attempt to block the attack, forcing the attacker to reroll the attack. (The attacker must use the new attack roll.) If the new attack roll is a critical miss, Baba Lysaga can immediately use her Hair Blades against the attacker. This reaction has no effect if the first attack was a critical hit.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Swarm.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn or Baba Lysaga takes damage from falling. <strong>Effect:</strong> Baba Lysaga uses her Swarm. If she would take damage from her fall, she takes no damage instead.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Hair Blades.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn after attacking Baba Lysaga with a melee attack. <strong>Effect:</strong> Baba Lysaga uses her Hair Blades against that creature.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Insect Shield (1/round).</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> Baba Lysaga takes damage from a spell shaped in a cone or line, or from a ranged spell attack roll. <strong>Effect:</strong> Baba Lysaga forces the spell’s caster to make a <span class="highlight">DC 17</span> saving throw using their spellcasting ability. On a failure, Baba Lysaga takes no damage from that spell this turn.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Lightning Bolt (1/round).</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Baba Lysaga uses her Spellcasting to cast <em>lightning bolt</em>.</p>
