[[Non-Player Characters#Martin & Viggo Martikov]]
* **Martin and Viggo** don’t know about Davian’s feud with Urwin, who they have never met. They don’t understand the full nature of Elric’s revolt against Castle Ravenloft, but know enough to understand that he died there. They most often feel playful, bored, fearful, intrigued, or excited, and should make the players feel flattered, amused, and endeared to them.
