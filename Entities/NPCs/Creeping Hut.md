  <p><strong><em>Close Quarters Fighter.</em></strong> The hut doesn't have disadvantage on its ranged attack rolls when within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Immutable Form.</em></strong> The hut is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Siege Monster.</em></strong> The hut deals double damage to objects and structures.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Stolen Gem.</em></strong> The hut is animated by a magic gem shaped like a viridian pinecone embedded in the stump beneath its floorboards, held in place by a black root (AC 15, 10 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage). A player who removes the hut’s floorboards as described in <span class="citation">U3. Baba Lysaga’s Hut (p. 163)</span> exposes the gem, and can remove the gem by destroying the root or succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The hut dies if the gem is removed.</p>
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Root.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: <span class="highlight">24 (3d10 + 8)</span> bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a <span class="highlight">DC 20 Strength saving throw</span> or be <span class="highlight">knocked prone</span> or <span class="highlight">pushed up to 10 feet</span> away. If the save fails by 10 or more, the hut can <span class="highlight">grapple</span> the target instead of pushing it or knocking it prone (escape DC 20).</p>
  <p><strong><em>Throw.</em></strong> A creature grappled by the hut must succeed on a <span class="highlight">DC 20 Strength saving throw</span> or be <span class="highlight">thrown 60 feet</span> away. A creature thrown in this way falls twenty feet and lands <span class="highlight">prone</span>.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Rock.</em></strong> Ranged Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: <span class="highlight">21 (3d8 + 8)</span> bludgeoning damage.</p>
  <h3>Reactions</h3>
  <p>The hut can take up to <strong>three reactions per round</strong>, but only one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent it from taking reactions, it loses one reaction instead.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> The hut can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting it. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
  <p><strong><em>Root.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn within 20 feet of the hut. <strong>Effect:</strong> The hut attacks that creature with its Root.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A creature attempts to retrieve the gem from the hut’s stump. <strong>Effect:</strong> The hut attempts to bite the creature’s arm or body with its floorboards, forcing that creature to succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8) piercing damage and be grappled (escape DC 20). While grappled in this way, a creature has disadvantage on checks made to retrieve the gem.</p>
