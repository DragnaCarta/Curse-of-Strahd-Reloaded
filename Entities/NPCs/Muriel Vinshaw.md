# **Roleplaying Information**
## ***Resonance.*** 
Muriel should inspire endearment with her enthusiastic, go-getter attitude, amusement with her snarky comments and cheerful sense of humor, and mild irritation with her stubbornness and occasional (though apologetic) refusals to reveal the secrets of the Keepers of the Feather.

## ***Emotions.*** 
Muriel most often feels curious, excited, determined, triumphant, gleeful, amused, angry, or sad.

## ***Motivations.*** 
Muriel wants to honor Elric's life through her resistance to Strahd and make a difference in the everyday lives of Barovians in her capacity as a field agent for the Keepers of the Feather.

## ***Inspirations.*** 
When playing Muriel, channel Amethyst (*Steven Universe*), Sokka (*Avatar: the Last Airbender*), and Peter Parker (*Spider-Man*).

# **Character Information**
## ***Persona.*** 
To the world, Muriel is a cheerful, if occasionally scatterbrained young woman. To those she trusts, Muriel is a determined field agent for the Keepers of the Feather, with a strong sense of justice and a fierce independent streak. Deep down, Muriel is still grieving the death of her fiancé, Elric Martikov, and wonders whether she'll ever fix what his death broke inside of her.

## ***Morale.*** 
In a fight, Muriel would gladly pull out her shortsword or crossbow and dare her opponent to strike first, fleeing only if her regeneration were blocked or outmatched.

## ***Relationships.*** 
Muriel is an agent of the Keepers of the Feather under [[Davian Martikov]], a contact and ally of Keeper spymaster Urwin Martikov, and the once-fiancé of Davian's deceased son, Elric Martikov, who was imprisoned while assisting Doru's rebellion against Castle Ravenloft.

    <p><strong><em>Plummet.</em></strong> If Muriel flies at least 20 feet straight toward a target while descending at least five feet toward the ground, and then hits that target with a shortsword attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
