# Ludmilla Vilisevic
**Roleplaying Information**

***Emotions.*** Ludmilla most often feels intrigued, annoyed, thoughtful, or (mildly) amused.

***Motivations.*** Ludmilla wants to conquer the secrets of magic and impress Strahd sufficiently to become his arcane advisor, as Khazan once was.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Ludmilla, channel Severus Snape (*Harry Potter*), Sherlock Holmes (*Sherlock*), and Dr. Gregory House (*House*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Ludmilla is an ambitious, detached, and sociopathic mage, dedicated to attaining knowledge and power at all costs.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Ludmilla would seek to lure her opponent into a pre-prepared trap, fleeing if outmatched and unable to meet the fight with some sort of advantage.

***Relationships.*** Ludmilla is Strahd's second-eldest vampiric bride and the matron of the coven of **Barovian witches** at Castle Ravenloft.

    <p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Ludmilla regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or running water. If she takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> Ludmilla can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight, Ludmilla takes 20 radiant damage at the start of her turn, and she has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Form of Mist.</em></strong> When Ludmilla is reduced to 0 hit points, her statistics are instantly replaced by the statistics of her second form. Her initiative count doesn't change. Excess damage doesn't carry over to her new form, but she retains any conditions she had in her previous form.</p>
    <h3>Actions</h3>
    <p><strong><em>Grease.</em></strong> Ludmilla casts <em>grease</em> (DC 15) in a 20-foot-square area.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Command.</em></strong> Ludmilla casts <em>command</em> (DC 15), targeting up to two creatures with the same command. If she is within 10 feet of all targets, she can speak a command of up to three words, rather than one.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Hypnotic Pattern (2/day).</em></strong> Ludmilla casts <em>hypnotic pattern</em> (DC 15).</p>
    <p><strong><em>Dimension Door (1/day).</em></strong> Ludmilla casts <em>dimension door.</em></p>
    <h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
    <p><strong><em>Shroud of Shadows (1/day).</em></strong> Ludmilla summons a shroud of shadows around her, which lasts for 8 hours or until she dismisses it as a bonus action. While the shroud remains, she gains a flying speed of 50 feet (hover) and has resistance to damage dealt by melee attacks. If Ludmilla resists damage in this way, the attacker takes the same amount and type of damage dealt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time Ludmilla takes radiant damage or damage from holy water while the shroud is present, the shroud weakens, reducing her flying speed to 25 feet and causing her to fall 20 feet. The second time Ludmilla takes radiant damage or damage from holy water while the shroud is present, the shroud immediately vanishes.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Entangling Slime.</em></strong> If Ludmilla is currently concentrating on a <em>grease</em> spell, she casts <em>web</em> (DC 15) without using concentration, targeting the same 20-foot-square area as the <em>grease</em> spell. The webs vanish when she loses her concentration on <em>grease.</em></p>
    <h3>Reactions</h3>
    <p>Ludmilla can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If she would lose her reactions, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Misty Step.</em></strong> In response to taking damage, Ludmilla casts <em>misty step.</em></p>
    <p><strong><em>Disrupt Spell (3/day).</em></strong> <em>3rd-Level Spell:</em> 60 feet, components S, instantaneous. <em>Effect:</em> Ludmilla attempts to disrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, it must make a DC 15 saving throw using its spellcasting ability. On a failure, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Mage's Reprisal.</em></strong> In response to being missed by a spell attack or succeeding on a saving throw against a spell, Ludmilla can immediately force the caster to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) force damage.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Contingency (1/day).</em></strong> If Ludmilla would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, a <em>contingency</em> spell activates, allowing her to gain the effects of <em>dimension door</em>. (Because Ludmilla doesn't cast the spell at the time of her reaction, it can't be countered.)</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Ludmilla makes two Shocking Grasp attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shocking Grasp.</em></strong> <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (2d8) lightning damage. On a hit, the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lightning Lance.</em></strong> A bolt of lightning arcs toward a creature of Ludmilla’s choice that she can see within 30 feet. Two bolts then leap from that creature to as many as two other creatures, each of which must be within 10 feet of the first creature. (A creature can be targeted by only one of the bolts.) Each creature must make a <span class="highlight">DC 15 Dexterity saving throw</span>, taking 9 (2d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Shroud of Shadows (1/day).</em></strong> Ludmilla summons a shroud of shadows around her, which lasts for 8 hours or until she dismisses it as a bonus action.

The second time Ludmilla takes radiant damage or damage from holy water while the shroud is present, the shroud immediately vanishes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Duplicate.</em></strong> Ludmilla creates a perfect, intangible illusion of herself that lasts until the start of her next turn. The illusion appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of her. Ludmilla can then magically switch places with the illusion. While the illusion remains, it perfectly mimics Ludmilla's actions, speech, and movement, though it cannot attack. A player can make a <span class="highlight">DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check</span> to determine which Ludmilla is illusory. The illusion vanishes if it takes any damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Freezing Ray.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Spell Attack:</em> +7 to hit, range 120 ft., three creatures. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (2d6) cold damage per ray.</p>
<p><strong><em>Darkness (1/day).</em></strong> Ludmilla casts <em>darkness</em> with a radius of 40 feet.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Ludmilla can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Ludmilla would lose her reactions, she loses one reaction instead..</p>
<p><strong><em>Misty Step.</em></strong> In response to taking damage or casting *darkness*, Ludmilla casts <em>misty step</em>. She can then immediately take the Hide action. If she’s flying, she has advantage on the check made to hide.</p>

<p><strong><em>Close Quarters Fighter.</em></strong> Ludmilla doesn't have disadvantage on her ranged attack rolls when within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Ludmilla regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If she takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> Ludmilla can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight, Ludmilla takes 20 radiant damage at the start of her turn, and she has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cold Sensitivity.</em></strong> When Ludmilla takes cold damage, she freezes into a corporeal form until the start of her next turn. While frozen in this way, she loses the attributes of her Mistform feature, loses her immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, gains vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage, loses her immunity to the grappled, prone, and restrained conditions, and loses her fly speed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mistsight.</em></strong> While within fog, Ludmilla has blindsight that extends to the edge of the fog, out to a maximum of 60 feet.
<p><strong><em>Mistform.</em></strong> Ludmilla can enter and occupy the space of another creature, and can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. She can't fall, and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated. However, while making a melee attack or grappling a target, Ludmilla loses these attributes, as well as her immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons and loses her immunity to the grappled, prone, and restrained conditions.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Ludmilla makes two attacks with her claws. She can replace one attack with a mist shards or bite attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage plus 2 (1d4) necrotic damage. Instead of dealing the slashing damage, Ludmilla can grapple the target (escape DC 14).</p>
<p><strong><em>Mist Shards.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by Ludmilla, incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Ludmilla regains hit points equal to that amount. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. Each time the target finishes a long rest without being bitten again, it can roll one of its hit dice and add its Constitution modifier. The target’s maximum hit points increase by an amount equal to the result. (This increase can’t raise the target’s hit points above its original maximum.).</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Dissipate.</em></strong> If Ludmilla is heavily obscured by mist or fog, she takes the Hide action.
<p><strong><em>Asphyxiate.</em></strong> One creature within 30 feet must make a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Constitution saving throw</span>. On a failure, the target's head is surrounded by a vacuum of air for 1 minute, or while Ludmilla maintains her concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). While surrounded by this vacuum, the target is deafened, can't speak, can't breathe (but can hold its breath), and has a number of levels of exhaustion equal to three minus the number of minutes of air it has left (minimum 0). In addition, a target surrounded by this vacuum must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns or lose 1 minute of air on a failure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target loses all levels of exhaustion gained in this way if it falls unconscious or the vacuum disappears. The vacuum disappears if Ludmilla takes the Hide action or if the target is ever behind full cover or more than 30 feet away from her.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Ludmilla can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Ludmilla would lose her reactions, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fog Cloud.</em></strong> In response to taking damage, Ludmilla casts <em>fog cloud</em> without concentration.
<p><strong><em>Poison Mist.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a creature within 5 feet, Ludmilla forces that creature to succeed on a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Constitution saving throw</span> or take 7 (2d6) poison damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ambush.</em></strong> In response to hearing or seeing a creature move within 30 feet while she's hidden, Ludmilla moves up to her speed toward it and attacks it with her claws.</p>
