  <p><strong><em>Keen Senses.</em></strong> Zorya has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, hearing, or smell.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Limited Telepathy.</em></strong> Zorya can magically communicate simple ideas, emotions, and images telepathically with any creature within 100 feet of it that can understand a language.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> Zorya has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Incorporeal Movement.</em></strong> Zorya can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. She takes 5 (1d10) force damage if she ends her turn inside an object.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Ghostfire.</em></strong> Any damage Zorya deals with her <strong><em>breath weapon</em></strong> to incorporeal creatures ignores immunity to cold damage.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Ethereal Escape (1/day)</em></strong>. If Zorya would be reduced to 0 hit points, she is instead reduced to 1 hit point and flees into the Ethereal Plane, returning to the Material Plane after 1 minute.</p>
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6).</em></strong> Zorya exhales an icy blast of silver fire in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
  <h3>Reactions</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Misty Step.</em></strong> In response to Zorya or a creature within 5 feet of her being hit or missed by an attack, Zorya casts <em>misty step</em>, bringing along up to one willing creature within 5 feet of her. A creature teleported in this way takes half damage from the triggering attack.</p>
