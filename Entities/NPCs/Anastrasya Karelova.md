# Anastrasya Karelova
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Anastrasya should inspire flattery for her compliments and charm, suspicion for her disguised efforts to probe for the players’ secrets, and disgust for her apathy toward the plight of the Barovian people.

***Emotions.*** Anastrasya most often feels calm, amused, satisfied, or intrigued.

***Motivations.*** Anastrasya wants to remove Volenta, Ludmilla, and the players as competitors to Strahd’s affections—by setting them against each other, if at all possible.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Anastrasya, channel Lara Raith (*The Dresden Files*), Margaery Tyrell (*Game of Thrones*), and Irene Adler (*Sherlock Holmes*)

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Anastrasya is an empathetic, thoughtful, and charming socialite. To those who know her better, Anastrasya is a cunning, merciless chessmaster with a penchant for worming her way out of even the stickiest situations.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Anastrasya would parlay for peace—and stab her enemy in the back as soon as an opportune moment presented itself.

***Relationships.*** Anastrasya is Strahd’s third-youngest bride and a former Vallakian noble from a now-extinct house.

<p><strong><em>Close Quarters Fighter.</em></strong> Anastrasya doesn't have disadvantage on her ranged attack rolls when within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Anastrasya regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If she takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> Anastrasya can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight, Anastrasya takes 20 radiant damage at the start of her turn, and she has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Skinchange.</em></strong> When Anastrasya is reduced to 0 hit points, her skin sloughs off, revealing a giant, bloated, grotesque bat. Her statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of her second form. Her initiative count doesn’t change. Excess damage doesn't carry over to her new form, but she retains any conditions she had in her previous form.
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Anastrasya makes three attacks with her flying sword, or two with her claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, Anastrasya can grapple the target (escape DC 13).</p>
<p><strong><em>Flying Sword.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Charm.</em></strong> One creature within 10 feet must make a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Wisdom saving throw</span>. On a failure, the target is magically charmed for 1 minute or until Anastrasya loses her concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). A target that can't see Anastrasya automatically succeeds. While charmed, the target regards Anastrasya as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected; it isn't under Anastrasya's control, but takes her requests and actions in the most favorable way and lets Anastrasya bite it. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
<p><strong><em>Telekinetic Thrust.</em></strong> Anastrasya chooses one object weighing 1 to 50 pounds within 30 feet that isn't being worn or carried. The object flies in a straight line up to 30 feet in a direction Anastrasya chooses before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Dexterity saving throw</span>. On a failed save, the object strikes the target and stops moving. When the object strikes something, the object and what it strikes each take 3d8 bludgeoning damage.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Anastrasya can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Anastrasya would lose her reactions, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Night's Retreat.</em></strong> In response to taking damage, Anastrasya can fly up to half her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Call Defender (1/round).</em></strong> In response to being targeted by an attack, if Anastrasya has charmed a creature, she commands that creature to use its reaction, if available, to move up to its speed toward her. If the charmed creature ends its movement within 5 feet of Anastrasya, it becomes the target of the attack instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Telekinetic Defense.</em></strong> In response to being targeted by an attack or spell, Anastrasya telekinetically summons one object weighing 1 to 50 pounds within 30 feet that isn't being worn or carried, gaining half cover against the triggering attack or spell.</p>

<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Anastrasya regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If she takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> Anastrasya can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight, Anastrasya takes 20 radiant damage at the start of her turn, and she has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Anastrasya makes three attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> <span class="highlight">+6 to hit</span>, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by Anastrasya, incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> <span class="highlight">6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage</span>. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Anastrasya regains hit points equal to that amount. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. Each time the target finishes a long rest without being bitten again, it can roll one of its hit dice and add its Constitution modifier. The target’s maximum hit points increase by an amount equal to the result. (This increase can’t raise the target’s hit points above its original maximum.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> <span class="highlight">+6 to hit</span>, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> <span class="highlight">8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage</span>. Instead of dealing damage, Anastrasya can grapple the target (escape <span class="highlight">DC 13</span>).</p>
<p><strong><em>Vomit Blood.</em></strong> Anastrasya spews blood in a <span class="highlight">15-foot cone</span>. Each creature in that area must make a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Dexterity saving throw</span>, taking <span class="highlight">7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and 3 (1d6) necrotic damage</span> on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Telekinetic Storm.</em></strong> Each creature within a <span class="highlight">5-foot radius</span> of Anastrasya must make a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Constitution saving throw</span>, taking <span class="highlight">4d4 force damage</span> on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horrific Screech.</em></strong> All creatures that can hear within a <span class="highlight">30-foot radius</span> must succeed on a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Constitution saving throw</span> or suffer the following effects: On a failed save, a creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and concentration checks until the start of Anastrasya's next turn. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, it is also frightened of Anastrasya until the start of her next turn. If a creature fails the save by 10 or more, it is also paralyzed until the end of Anastrasya's next turn.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Anastrasya can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Anastrasya would lose her reactions, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wing Attack.</em></strong> When Anastrasya takes damage from a creature within 5 feet of her, she can force the attacker to make a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Strength saving throw</span>. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed back <span class="highlight">10 feet</span>. If they fail the save by 5 or more, they also fall prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vampiric Command.</em></strong> When a creature moves within 10 feet of Anastrasya or damages her while within 10 feet of her, she can use her reaction to force the creature to make a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Wisdom saving throw</span>. On a failed save, Anastrasya can command the creature as if she had cast the <em>command</em> spell, without expending a spell slot or using any components.</p>
