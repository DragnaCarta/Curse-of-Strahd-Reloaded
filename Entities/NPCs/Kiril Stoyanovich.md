    <p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Kiril regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn. If he takes necrotic damage or bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a silvered weapon, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Keen Hearing and Smell.</em></strong> Kiril has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Second Phase.</em></strong> When Kiril is reduced to 0 hit points, he digs his claws into his chest, pulls out his own heart, and devours it. He then doubles in height and breadth, gaining a hunched back, bony protrusions along his arms and shoulders, and a grotesque, bloated head with oversized fangs and teeth, as well as a pair of toothy jaws for eyes. His statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of his second form. His initiative count doesn’t change. Excess damage and conditions don’t carry over to his new form.</p>
    <h3>Actions</h3>
    <p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Kiril makes three melee attacks, up to one of which can be a Bite.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>, +9 to hit, range 5 ft., 1 target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>, +9 to hit, range 5 ft., 1 target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a Humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werewolf lycanthropy until Kiril dies. If the target was already cursed with werewolf lycanthropy, it can't regenerate until it completes a long rest.</p>
    <h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
    <p><strong><em>Alpha's Howl.</em></strong> Any number of targets within 60 feet that can hear Kiril and that Kiril has cursed with werewolf lycanthropy must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, losing one level of lycanthrope corruption on a success (minimum 0). On a failure, a target gains one level of lycanthrope corruption (maximum 2) and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move up to its speed toward a random creature other than Kiril and make a number of unarmed strikes against it equal to its number of levels of lycanthrope corruption.</p>
    <p>A target with one level of lycanthrope corruption gains wolflike claws and can use its claws to make an unarmed strike, dealing 2d4 slashing damage plus its Strength modifier (minimum 2) on a hit. A target with two levels of lycanthrope corruption also gains a wolflike muzzle and can use its bite to make an unarmed strike, dealing 1d8 piercing damage plus its Strength modifier (minimum 2) on a hit. A Humanoid bitten in this way must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werewolf lycanthropy until Kiril dies.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Savage Frenzy.</em></strong> Kiril leaps up to his speed without triggering opportunity attacks. Each creature within 5 feet of him must then make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Shapechange.</em></strong> Kiril polymorphs into his human form or into a dire wolf, or back into his true form (a wolf-humanoid hybrid). His statistics, other than his AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. He reverts to his human form if he dies.</p>
    <h3>Reactions</h3>
    <p>Kiril can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent him from taking reactions, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Kiril can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting him. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
    <p><strong><em>Pounce.</em></strong>  In response to a creature moving within 30 feet, Kiril moves up to his speed toward it without triggering opportunity attacks.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> In response to being missed by an attack made by a creature within 5 feet, Kiril attacks that creature with his claws.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> In response to being hit by an attack made by a creature within 5 feet, Kiril attacks that creature with his bite.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Kiril regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes necrotic damage or bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a silvered weapon, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Keen Hearing and Smell.</em></strong> Kiril has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Weak Grip.</em></strong> If Kiril takes 30 damage or more on a single turn, he must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw at the end of that turn or release any creatures he is grappling.</p>
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Kiril makes one attack with his claws and one attack with his bite. He can replace the bite with a swallow if he already has a target restrained with his bite.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, range 10 ft., 1 target. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be pushed 5 feet away or grappled (Kiril's choice).</p>
  <p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, range 10 ft., 1 target. Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and Kiril can't bite another target.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Swallow.</em></strong> Kiril makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature he has restrained with his bite. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside Kiril, and it takes 7 (2d6) acid damage at the start of each of Kiril's turns. If Kiril takes 20 damage or more on a single turn, he must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of him. Kiril must also immediately regurgitate all swallowed creatures if he dies.</p>
  <h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Nightmare Howl.</em></strong> Each creature within 60 feet of Kiril that can hear him must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 5 (2d4) psychic damage and is frightened until the start of Kiril's next turn. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target can’t be frightened by Kiril's Nightmare Howl for the next 24 hours.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Shadow Beam.</em></strong> A 5-foot-wide, 100-foot-long beam of swirling shadows bursts from Kiril’s maw. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. A target grappled by Kiril’s bite automatically fails the saving throw.</p>
  <h3>Reactions</h3>
  <p>Kiril can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent him from taking reactions, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Kiril can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting him. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
  <p><strong><em>Leap.</em></strong> In response to a creature moving within 30 feet, Kiril leaps toward it without provoking opportunity attacks. Each creature within a 5-foot radius of him must then immediately make a DC 18 Strength saving throw or fall prone.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Rend.</em></strong> In response to a creature moving within his reach, Kiril attacks it with his claws. If the attack misses, that creature has advantage on its next attack against Kiril before the start of its next turn.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Pin.</em></strong> In response to being missed by an attack made by a creature within reach, Kiril forces that creature to make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failure, that creature is knocked prone and either shoved 20 feet away or grappled (Kiril's choice).</p>
