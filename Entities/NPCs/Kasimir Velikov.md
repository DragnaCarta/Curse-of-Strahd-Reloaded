# Kasimir Velikov

**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Kasimir should make the players feel grateful for his competence and genuine interest in assisting them, mildly insulted by his slight condescension, mildly suspicious of his caginess, and sympathetic to his sorrow for the plight of his people.

***Emotions.*** Kasimir most often feels curious, frustrated, suspicious, excited, melancholy, nostalgic, somber, or regretful.

***Motivations.*** Kasimir wants to ensure the safety of the dusk elves and resurrect his sister, Patrina, once he’s freed her of Strahd’s dark influence and seen Strahd destroyed.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Kasimir, channel Stephen Strange (*Doctor Strange*), Sherlock Holmes (*Sherlock*), Spock (*Star Trek*), and the Twelfth Doctor (*Doctor Who*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Kasimir is a quiet and withdrawn scholar, with a powerful curiosity and a fierce dedication to his people. To those he trusts, Kasimir is a lost and broken man, guilt-ridden for his role in Patrina’s death and resigned to somber despair for the dusk elves’ future. Only Kasimir knows the lengths to which he is willing to go to resurrect his sister—and the price he is willing to pay.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Kasimir would attempt to negotiate a peace, but would not hesitate to unleash his most powerful spells—or use his magic to escape—if a diplomatic solution proved untenable.

***Relationships.*** Kasimir is the leader of the dusk elf encampment and the younger brother of the late Patrina Velikovna, a **banshee** who resides in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft. Kasimir is also the cousin of Rahadin, Strahd’s chamberlain, and the nephew of the late dusk elf prince, Erevan Löwenhart. (Kasimir is not a direct blood relation of Erevan, who married Kasimir’s aunt, Lorelei.)# WotC source:
