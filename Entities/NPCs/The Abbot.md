# The Abbot
## Before Redemption
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** The Abbot should inspire discomfort with his stoicism and routine observations regarding "mortals," disgust for his lack of respect for human life or values, anger for his supreme and unshakeable self-confidence, and gratitude for his (somewhat off-putting) friendliness and willingness to cure the players of lycanthropy without cost.

***Emotions.*** The Abbot most often feels curious, intrigued, cold, dispassionate, or (rarely) enraged.

***Motivations.*** The Abbot wants to lift the "curse" upon Barovia and preserve the "sanctity" of the Abbey of Saint Markovia.

***Inspirations.*** When playing the Abbot, channel Vision (*Marvel*), Data (*Star Trek*), and Dr. Manhattan (*Watchmen*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, the Abbot is a serene, but inhumanly dispassionate holy man and "scientist." Only the Abbot knows that he is Ithuriel: an angel of the Morninglord sent to honor the memory of Saint Markovia.

***Morale.*** In a fight, the Abbot would reveal his divine form, then command his enemies to lay down their weapons and surrender. If they failed to do so, he would attack them mercilessly, seeking to crush any resistance until and unless they surrendered or fled.

***Relationships.*** The Abbot, an angel of the Morninglord once called Ithuriel, is the master of the Abbey of Saint Markovia, including the **mongrelfolk** Otto, Zygfrek, and Clovin Belview. He is also the creator of the **flesh golem** Vasilka and the resurrector of Kala Krezkova.

<hr>
<p><strong><em>Close Quarters Fighter.</em></strong> Ithuriel doesn't have disadvantage on his ranged attack rolls when within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> Ithuriel's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 19). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components:<br>
At will: detect evil and good<br>
1/day each: commune, raise dead</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> Ithuriel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fallen Grace.</em></strong> When Ithuriel is reduced to 0 hit points, his form expands and twists, becoming a massive creature with the head of a lion, the body of a ram, the wings of a bat, and the tail of a crocodile. His statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of his second form. His initiative count doesn't change, excess damage doesn't carry over to his new form, and he retains none of the conditions he had in his previous form.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Ithuriel makes two attacks. He can replace one of those attacks with <strong><em>ray of light</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mace.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) radiant damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Palm.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and Ithuriel can force the target to make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is pushed up to 10 feet away or grappled (escape DC 18).</p>
<p><strong><em>Ray of Light.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Spell Attack:</em> +10 to hit, range 30 feet, one target. <em>Hit:</em> The target takes 9 (2d8) radiant damage and is outlined in radiant light until the end of Ithuriel's next turn. Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Healing Touch (5/Day).</em></strong> Ithuriel touches another creature. The target magically regains 24 (4d8 + 5) hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.</p>
<p><strong><em>Change Shape.</em></strong> Ithuriel magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than his own, or back into its true form. He reverts to his true form if he is reduced to 0 hit points. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (Ithuriel's choice). In a new form, Ithuriel retains his game statistics and ability to speak, but his AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and he gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that he lacks.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Divine Wind.</em></strong> Ithuriel unleashes a powerful gale from his angelic wings in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) slashing damage and be pushed 10 feet away.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sacred Radiance (1/day).</em></strong> Ithuriel's form bursts with divine light. Each creature that can see him within 20 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) radiant damage. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is also blinded until the start of Ithuriel's next turn. A creature that fails the saving throw by 10 or more is also charmed by Ithuriel until the start of his next turn. While charmed in this way, the creature must fall prone to grovel before Ithuriel at the start of its turn, then immediately end its turn.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Ithuriel can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent him from taking reactions, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Ithuriel can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting it. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Punish.</em></strong> In response to an enemy hitting or missing him with a melee attack, Ithuriel makes a <strong><em>palm</em></strong> attack against it. 
<p><strong><em>Descend.</em></strong> In response to hitting an enemy with a Palm attack or Punish reaction, if Ithuriel has grappled that enemy and is at least 40 feet in the air, he can then move up to his speed toward the ground without provoking opportunity attacks and force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target falls prone, it takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, and Ithuriel can use up to his remaining movement, if any, to push it in a straight line in any direction while grinding it against the earth, dealing an additional 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage per 10 feet moved along the ground. (This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Ascend.</em></strong> In response to taking damage, Ithuriel releases any creatures he has grappled, then flies up to one third of his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shift (Costs 2 Reactions).</em></strong> In response to suffering one of the following conditions, Ithuriel momentarily assumes the form of the corresponding beast, ending the condition: blinded (giant bat), grappled (octopus), paralyzed (giant poisonous snake), prone (giant spider), restrained (mouse), or stunned (jellyfish). Ithuriel then immediately returns to his true form.</p>

<p><strong><em>Close Quarters Fighter.</em></strong> Ithuriel doesn't have disadvantage on his ranged attack rolls when within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> Ithuriel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Ithuriel makes one attack with his claws and one with his bite or radiant darts</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) radiant damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and Ithuriel can't bite another target.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Radiant Darts.</em></strong> +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., three separate targets. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) radiant damage.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Erupt Earth.</em></strong> Ithuriel slams his tail against the ground, causing fountains of churned earth and stone to erupt in a 5-foot radius around him. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and fall prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Eclipse Beam (Recharge 5-6).</em></strong> Ithuriel exhales a burst of brilliant radiance and shadowy mirk in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) radiant damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Ithuriel can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent him from taking reactions, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Ithuriel can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting it. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> In response to being missed or hit by a melee attack, Ithuriel makes the following attack against the attacker: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d4 + 6) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw. On a failure, Ithuriel can either knock it prone or push it up to 5 feet away (Ithuriel's choice). </p>
<p><strong><em>Wings (1/round).</em></strong> In response to a creature he can see completing a spell, making an attack, or moving to a space within 60 feet of him, Ithuriel beats his wings, forcing each creature within 5 feet of him to succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet away and knocked prone. Ithuriel can then fly up to his speed toward the original creature without triggering opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence (1/day).</em></strong> In response to assuming his second form, Ithuriel forces each creature of his choice within 120 feet that is aware of him to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature is frightened of Ithuriel until the end of its next turn. A creature that fails the saving throw and has 30 hit points or fewer falls unconscious for 1 minute, until it takes damage, or until someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.</p>
</div>

## After Redemption
Ithuriel uses the statistics of a **pegasus**, but with the **healing touch** feature of a **unicorn** and the size, creature type, languages, and ***change shape*** feature of a **deva**. Replace the pegasus’s ***hooves*** attack with the following: ***Mace.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 1d6 + 4 bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) radiant damage. In addition, Ithuriel can cast *raise dead* once per day, but no more than three times per year.

**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Ithuriel should inspire endearment for his determination to repair the harm he has done, comfort for his deep compassion and care, and gratitude for his earnest efforts to aid the players.

***Emotions.*** Ithuriel most often feels thoughtful, sorrowful, cheerful, guilty, ashamed, apprehensive, defiant, bold, or serene.

***Motivations.*** Ithuriel wants to repair the harm he has done to Vasilka, the Belviews, the Krezkovs, and the players, and to defend the Abbey and the village of Krezk from those who might wish them harm.

***Inspirations.*** When roleplaying Ithuriel, channel Zuko (*Avatar: The Last Airbender*), Neji Hyuuga (*Naruto*), and Father Forthill (*The Dresden Files*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Ithuriel is a mature, contemplative youth with a strong sense of humility and a deep compassion for others. To those he trusts, Ithuriel is a young angel persevering to reassemble his purpose and identity following his corruption, defeat, and restoration.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Ithuriel would seek to calm his foe, but would not hesitate to forcefully defend an innocent threatened by enemies of ill intent.
