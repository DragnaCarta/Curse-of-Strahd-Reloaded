[[Non-Player Characters]]
# Karl Wachter
## **Personality**
- Withdrawn, sardonic, sharp-eyed.
- Speaks less, but when he talks, it _hurts._
- More wounded than wicked.
- Shows signs of having read one (1) book and letting it change him completely.
## **Behavioral Notes**
- Leans against walls; fades into shadows.
- Laughs softly at Nikolai’s failures more than at jokes.
- Watches everyone with a predator’s stillness, but not a predator’s intent.
## **Emotional Pressure Points**
- Secret guilt about the Wachter cult business—he knows it’s wrong but thinks resistance is pointless.
- Feels overshadowed by Nikolai despite being smarter.
- Quietly yearns for someone to treat him as a human, not an accessory to his mother.
## **How He Treats the PCs**
- **Arden:** Studies him like an animal watching a thunderstorm. Respects strength but says nothing.
- **Fig:** Mild respect; Fig’s discipline is alien to him.
- **Choppy:** Will absolutely ask Choppy uncomfortable questions about magic.
- **Varnish:** Karl sees right through Varnish in a weird, unsettling way—something about the bardic facade intrigues him.
