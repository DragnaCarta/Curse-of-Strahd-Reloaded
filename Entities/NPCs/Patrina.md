  <p><strong><em>Incorporeal Movement.</em></strong> Patrina can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. She takes <span class="highlight">5 (1d10) force damage</span> if she ends her turn inside an object.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Sunlight Sensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight, Patrina has <span class="highlight">disadvantage</span> on ability checks and attack rolls.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Dark Embodiment.</em></strong> When Patrina is reduced to <span class="highlight">0 hit points</span>, all amber sarcophagi within <span class="highlight">60 feet</span> of her extrude tendrils of shadowed mist, which she inhales. Her ethereal form then grows solid, forming pale, undead flesh and sunken amber eyes. Her statistics are instantly replaced by those of her second form. Her initiative count doesn’t change, excess damage doesn’t carry over, and she retains none of the conditions she had in her previous form. She can immediately use her <strong><em>soul weapon</em></strong> feature.</p>
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Patrina makes two attacks, only one of which can be an <strong><em>amber tentacle</em></strong> attack, and can use <strong><em>charm wielder</em></strong> once.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Amber Tentacle.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target within 15 feet of one of the walls in <span class="citation">X42. Amber Vault</span>. <strong>Hit:</strong> <span class="highlight">19 (2d12 + 6) bludgeoning damage</span>, and the target must succeed on a <span class="highlight">DC 19 Strength saving throw</span> or be <span class="highlight">grappled</span> (escape DC 19) or <span class="highlight">pushed 10 feet away</span> (Patrina’s choice). If the target fails the save by <span class="highlight">10 or more</span>, it also <span class="highlight">falls prone</span>.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Corrupting Touch.</em></strong> <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 16 (4d6 + 2) necrotic damage.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Charm Wielder.</em></strong> Patrina forces the creature possessing the <em>Sunsword</em> to succeed on a <span class="highlight">DC 19 Charisma saving throw</span> or be <span class="highlight">charmed</span> by her for <span class="highlight">1 minute</span>. While charmed, the creature must try to follow Patrina’s commands. If the creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. The effect ends if the creature no longer possesses the <em>Sunsword</em>.</p>
  <h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Animate Golems (1/Day).</em></strong> Patrina summons shards of amber from X40, Sealed Treasury, and shapes them into two <strong>amber constructs</strong>. An amber construct acts on Patrina’s initiative, but takes its turn immediately after hers.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Conjure Sarcophagi.</em></strong> Hollow amber sarcophagi spring into existence around each creature of Patrina’s choice within <span class="highlight">5 feet</span> of Patrina or a point she can see within <span class="highlight">30 feet</span>. Each creature must succeed on a <span class="highlight">DC 19 Dexterity saving throw</span> or be entrapped within its sarcophagus. Each sarcophagus has <span class="highlight">AC 15</span>, <span class="highlight">15 hit points</span>, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p>
  <h3>Reactions</h3>
  <p>Patrina can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent her from taking reactions, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Patrina can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting her. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
  <p><strong><em>Counterspell (1/round).</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> Patrina sees a creature within <span class="highlight">60 feet</span> of her cast a spell. <strong>Effect:</strong> Patrina casts <em>counterspell</em> at 3rd level. A creature whose spell would be countered in this way can use its reaction to spend a spell slot of 1st level or higher and add the spell slot’s level to the level of the spell it cast. If the result is <span class="highlight">4 or more</span>, the creature can make a <span class="highlight">DC 19 saving throw</span> using its spellcasting ability, gaining a bonus to its saving throw equal to the result. On a success, Patrina’s <em>counterspell</em> fails and has no effect.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Ghostly Walk.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A creature Patrina can see within <span class="highlight">60 feet</span> of her ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Patrina moves up to her speed toward or away from that creature without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Amber Tentacle (2/round).</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> Patrina takes damage from a creature she can see within <span class="highlight">30 feet</span>. <strong>Effect:</strong> Patrina makes an <strong><em>amber tentacle</em></strong> attack against that creature.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Soul Weapon.</em></strong> If Patrina isn’t holding the <em>Sunsword</em> at the start of her turn, it magically appears in her empty hand as her <strong><em>Shadowblade</em></strong>, a blade of pure darkness springing from the hilt.</p>
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Patrina makes four attacks with her <strong><em>shadowblade</em></strong>. She can replace up to one of those attacks with her <strong><em>life drain</em></strong>.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Shadowblade.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <strong><em>Hit:</em></strong> <span class="highlight">12 (2d8 + 3) necrotic damage</span>.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Life Drain.</em></strong> <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <strong><em>Hit:</em></strong> <span class="highlight">8 (2d4 + 3) necrotic damage</span>. If the target is a creature, its hit point maximum decreases by an amount equal to the damage taken, and Patrina regains hit points equal to the damage dealt.</p>
  <h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Crackling Doom.</em></strong> Crackling bolts of lightning arc from Patrina's fingertips in a <span class="highlight">30-foot cone</span>. Each creature in that area must make a <span class="highlight">DC 19 Dexterity saving throw</span>, taking <span class="highlight">14 (4d6) lightning damage</span> on a failure or half as much on a success. If a creature fails its save by <span class="highlight">5 or more</span>, it is <span class="highlight">slowed</span> until the start of Patrina’s next turn. (A slowed creature must spend <span class="highlight">1 extra foot of movement for every foot it moves</span> using its speed, attack rolls against it have <span class="highlight">advantage</span>, and it has <span class="highlight">disadvantage</span> on Dexterity saving throws.)</p>
  <p><strong><em>Negative Energy Burst.</em></strong> Negative energy ripples out in a <span class="highlight">5-foot-radius sphere</span> from Patrina or a point she can see within <span class="highlight">90 feet</span>. Each creature in that area must make a <span class="highlight">DC 19 Constitution saving throw</span>, taking <span class="highlight">14 (4d6) necrotic damage</span> on a failure or half as much on a success. If a creature fails its save by <span class="highlight">5 or more</span>, it also <span class="highlight">falls prone</span>.</p>
  <h3>Reactions</h3>
  <p>Patrina can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent her from taking reactions, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Patrina can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting her. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
  <p><strong><em>Parry (1/Round).</em></strong> <em>Trigger:</em> Patrina is hit by a melee or ranged attack while holding the <em>Sunsword</em>. <em>Effect:</em> Patrina adds <span class="highlight">+6</span> to her Armor Class against that attack, possibly causing it to miss.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Vile Teleport (1/Round).</em></strong> <em>Trigger:</em> A creature Patrina can see within <span class="highlight">30 feet</span> ends its turn. <em>Effect:</em> Patrina teleports up to <span class="highlight">30 feet</span> toward or away from that creature. She can cause each creature within <span class="highlight">5 feet</span> of her destination space to take <span class="highlight">10 (3d6) necrotic damage</span>.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Fell Rebuke.</em></strong> <em>Trigger:</em> Patrina is hit by an attack. <em>Effect:</em> Patrina utters a fell word, dealing <span class="highlight">10 (3d6) necrotic damage</span> to the attacker. She then teleports up to <span class="highlight">30 feet</span> to an unoccupied space she can see, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying.</p>
