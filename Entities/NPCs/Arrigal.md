# Arrigal
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Arrigal should make the players feel insulted by his slight condescension, unnerved by his intense curiosity and veneer of cheerful courtesy, and—when they learn of it—both disgusted by and sympathetic to his decision to serve Strahd.

***Emotions.*** Arrigal most often feels curious, suspicious, frustrated, resentful, relaxed, or amused.

***Motivations.*** Arrigal wants to protect his family and ensure a bright future for Barovia’s Vistani, free of the resentments of the small-minded Barovians—a goal which he intends to accomplish by serving Strahd.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Arrigal, channel Loki (*Thor*), Littlefinger (*A Game of Thrones*), and Hannibal Lecter (*The Silence of the Lambs*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Arrigal is Luvash’s enforcer and adviser: a cautious, cheerful, and curious man who prefers to remain aloof from the troubles of others. To those he trusts, Arrigal is a dedicated uncle, a fierce advocate for the Vistani, and a duelist with a slew of deadly skills. Only Arrigal knows that he serves [[Strahd von Zarovich]] faithfully as one of his spies—and that he would go to great lengths to serve the vampire’s will in exchange for the prosperity of his family and people.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Arrigal would act with ruthless cunning, retreating as necessary before striking from the shadows, using deceit, manipulation, or dirty tricks to ensure an advantage.

***Relationships.*** Arrigal is Luvash’s younger brother and Arabelle’s uncle. He is also a spy for Strahd and makes regular reports to Anastrasya, one of Strahd’s vampiric brides.# WotC source:
