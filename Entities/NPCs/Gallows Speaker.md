<p><strong><em>Close Quarters Fighter.</em></strong> The gallows speaker doesn't have disadvantage on its ranged attack rolls when within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Divination Senses.</em></strong> The gallows speaker can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wrath of the Traitor.</em></strong> If the gallows speaker is reduced to 0 hit points, the golden wisps around it wink out, revealing five daggers with wavy blades and lacquered hilts colored red, black, and gold. All of the gallows speaker's current effects end, and its statistics are instantly replaced by those of the <strong>Ba’al Verzi Avenger</strong>. Its initiative remains the same. Excess damage doesn't carry over to its new form, but it retains any conditions it had in its previous form.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The gallows speaker makes two attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Foretelling Touch.</em></strong> <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (2d10 + 4) psychic damage, and the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the next attack roll or saving throw it makes before the start of the gallows speaker's next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Will-o'-Wisp.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Spell Attack:</em> +8 to hit, range 30 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (3d8) necrotic damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Deathly Visions.</em></strong> The gallows speaker forces a creature that it can see within 30 feet to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, flooding its mind with terrifying images of its own violent death. On a failure, that creature is paralyzed until the start of the gallows speaker’s next turn.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Lash of Souls.</em></strong> Ethereal chains lash out around the gallows speaker, forcing up to two creatures within 5 feet to succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or take 9 (2d8) necrotic damage and be restrained until the start of the gallows speaker’s next turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage and isn’t restrained.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wisplight Flare.</em></strong> The gallows speaker directs one of its wisps to a point within 30 feet, where it flares with golden light. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) radiant damage and be blinded until the start of the gallows speaker's next turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage and isn't blinded.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>The gallows speaker can take up to three reactions per round, though no more than one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent it from taking reactions, it loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> The gallows speaker can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting it. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Death's Revelation.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a creature within range, the gallows speaker attacks that creature with its <strong><em>foretelling touch</em></strong> or <strong><em>will-o'-wisp</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ghostly Step.</em></strong> In response to taking damage, the gallows speaker teleports up to 15 feet away. It can then immediately force each creature within 5 feet of its new location to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Each creature that fails the saving throw is frightened until the end of that creature's next turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Close Quarters Fighter.</em></strong> The gallows speaker doesn't have disadvantage on its ranged attack rolls when within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Divination Senses.</em></strong> The gallows speaker can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong><em>Incorporeal Movement.</em></strong> The gallows speaker can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The gallows speaker makes two attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ba'al Verzi Dagger.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +8 to hit, range 30 feet, one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage and the target must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and becoming cursed until the start of the gallows speaker’s next turn on a failure. On a success, the target takes half the necrotic damage and isn't cursed. While cursed in this way, a creature moves at half speed and can't regain hit points, and the gallows speaker has advantage on attack rolls made against it. The gallows speaker doesn't gain disadvantage on an attack roll made with this attack due to being within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Grasp of the Grave.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 18 (4d8) necrotic damage and the target is grappled until the gallows speaker loses its concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) or until the target uses its action to break free (escape DC 16). (Dragging this target doesn't cause the gallows speaker to move more slowly.) The gallows speaker can then immediately move up to half its speed without triggering opportunity attacks. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes an additional 9 (2d8) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns, and the gallows speaker can't use <strong><em>grasp of the grave</em></strong> on another target.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Shrieking Souls.</em></strong> A shroud of moaning spirits surrounds each creature within 5 feet of the gallows speaker. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) necrotic damage and be dazed until the start of the gallows speaker’s next turn. (A dazed creature can move or take one action on its turn, not both. It also can’t take a bonus action or a reaction.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Wail of the Forsaken (Recharge 5-6).</em></strong> The spirits within the gallows speaker’s cloak let out a maddened, burbling cry. Each creature within 60 feet must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of the gallows speaker’s next turn.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>The avenger can take up to three reactions per round, though no more than one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent it from taking reactions, it loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> The gallows speaker can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting it. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Ghastly Foresight.</em></strong> In response to being targeted by an attack or a spell that requires a saving throw, the gallows speaker imposes disadvantage on the attack roll or grants itself advantage on the saving throw. After the roll is made, the gallows speaker can immediately move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Traitor's Noose.</em></strong> In response to being targeted by a melee attack, the gallows speaker manifests a spectral noose that hangs loosely around the attacker's neck, forcing them to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the attacker is filled with a brief and blinding rage toward another creature of the gallows speaker’s choice, and must instead immediately use its reaction, if available, to move up its speed toward that creature and make the same melee attack against that creature instead. The noose then disappears.</p>
<p><strong><em>Haunting Echoes.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a creature, the gallows speaker forces that creature to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, that creature takes 10 (4d4) psychic damage and has disadvantage on the next attack roll or ability check it makes before the start of its next turn.</p>
