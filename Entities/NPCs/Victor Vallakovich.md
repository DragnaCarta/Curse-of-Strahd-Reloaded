# Victor Vallakovich
Victor’s spellbook contains the _sending_ and _fear_ spells and does not contain _remove curse._

**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Victor should make the players feel annoyed at his suspicion and condescension, sympathetic to his anxiety, frustration, and desperation, and endeared to his stubborn determination to see Stella healed.

***Emotions.*** Victor most often feels curious, frustrated, suspicious, excited, bored, anxious, desperate, or determined.

***Motivations.*** Victor wants to restore Stella’s soul to her body and escape Barovia.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Victor, channel Jonathan Byers (*Stranger Things*), Prince Zuko (*Avatar: The Last Airbender*), Raven (*Teen Titans*), and Perrin Aybara (*Wheel of Time*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Victor is a quiet, moody, and isolated young man with an awkward manner and a total lack of social graces. To those he trusts, Victor is a devoted and compassionate friend, with a spark of brilliance and the stubbornness of a mule. Only Victor knows that he secretly fears losing Stella’s friendship—both due to the harm caused by his *teleportation circle* and due to the time she’s spent with Erasmus van Richten in the Ethereal Plane.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Victor would attempt to flee, but would resort to his most dangerous spells with wanton and amateurish abandon if cornered or if defending his friends or family.

***Relationships.*** Victor is the only child of Baron Vargas Vallakovich and Baroness Lydia Petrovna. He is a close friend to Stella Wachter, and a friendly (though wary) acquaintance to the ghost of Erasmus van Richten. Victor despises and fears Izek Strazni, who killed Victor’s childhood cat, Murka, by kicking it across a room when it wandered into his path two years ago. (Victor has since reanimated Murka’s skeleton through the use of his *animate dead* spell.)# WotC source:
