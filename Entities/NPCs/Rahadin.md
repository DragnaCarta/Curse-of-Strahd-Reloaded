# Rahadin

**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Rahadin should inspire anger for his condescension and unease for his deadly calm and undying devotion to carrying out Strahd’s will.

***Emotions.*** Rahadin most often feels calm, disdainful, satisfied, bored, or irritated. 

***Motivations.*** Rahadin wants to serve Strahd’s will as his faithful, ever-loyal servant—no matter the cost to himself or others.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Rahadin, channel Tywin Lannister (*Game of Thrones*), Severus Snape (*Harry Potter*), and Agent Smith (*The Matrix*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Rahadin is Strahd’s loyal right-hand man and merciless enforcer. Only Rahadin knows the depths of his dedication to the Von Zarovich family, who he believes saved him from shame and despair.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Rahadin would immediately draw his weapons and softly offer his opponent an opportunity to stand down—then attack mercilessly and with every strategic advantage if denied.

***Relationships.*** Rahadin is the chamberlain of Castle Ravenloft, the adopted brother of Strahd von Zarovich, the cousin of the dusk elf Kasimir Velikov, the son of the late dusk elf prince Erevan Löwenhart (the original owner of the blade that would later become the *Sunsword*), and the killer of the dusk elf women (excepting the **banshee** Patrina Velikov, who was killed by her brother Kasimir).

<p><strong><em>Close Quarters Fighter.</em></strong> Rahadin doesn't have disadvantage on his ranged attack rolls when within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Screams of the Dead.</em></strong> Any creature within 10 feet of Rahadin that isn't protected by a <em>mind blank</em> spell hears in its mind the screams of the thousands of people Rahadin has killed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fey Ancestry.</em></strong> Rahadin has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put him to sleep.</p>
<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> Rahadin's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence. He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:<br>
- 3/day: phantom steed<br>
- 1/day: nondetection</p>
<p><strong><em>Mask of the Wild.</em></strong> Rahadin can attempt to hide even when he is only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>
<p><strong><em>Murderous Instinct.</em></strong> When Rahadin drops to 0 hit points, he stows his saber and draws his twin scimitars, <em>Thorn</em> and <em>Chain</em>. His statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of his second form. His initiative count doesn't change. Excess damage doesn't carry over to his new form, and he doesn’t retain any conditions he had in his previous form.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Rahadin makes two attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Saber.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (1d8 + 6) slashing damage, and Rahadin can push the target up to 5 feet away. Instead of pushing the target, Rahadin can force it to succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Poisoned Dart.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (1d4 + 6 plus 2d4) piercing and poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of Rahadin's next turn.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Wind Strike.</em></strong> Rahadin moves up to his speed in a straight line toward an unoccupied space he can see, including through enemy spaces, without provoking opportunity attacks. Each creature within 5 feet of a space he passes through must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Whirling Blades.</em></strong> Each creature within 10 feet of Rahadin must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Rahadin can take up to three reactions per round, though no more than one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent him from taking reactions, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Rahadin can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting him. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Punishing Strike.</em></strong> When Rahadin is hit by a melee or ranged attack, he can use his reaction to move up to his speed toward the attacker and make an attack with his saber. This movement doesn't trigger opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Disarm.</em></strong> When an enemy misses Rahadin with a melee attack while wielding a weapon, he can use his reaction to force that enemy to make a DC 19 Strength saving throw, with advantage if the enemy is holding the weapon with two hands. On a failure, the enemy drops the item, which is knocked 10 feet away.</p>
<p><strong><em>Misty Step (1/round).</em></strong> When an enemy misses Rahadin with an attack or deals damage to him, he can use his reaction to cast <em>misty step</em>. He can then immediately take the Hide action. Rahadin doesn't need to see his destination when casting <em>misty step</em> in this way.</p>
<p><strong><em>Psychic Scream (1/day).</em></strong> When Rahadin is reduced to 0 hit points, he can use his reaction to cause his deathly choir to release a terrible scream. Each creature within 60 feet of Rahadin must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) psychic damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also stunned until the start of Rahadin's next turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mask of the Wild.</em></strong> Rahadin can attempt to hide even when he is only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Rahadin makes three attacks with his scimitars <strong><em>Thorn</em></strong> and/or <strong><em>Chain</em></strong>. He can replace one attack with his <strong><em>haunt</em></strong> feature.
<p><strong><em>Thorn.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (1d6 + 6) slashing damage, and Rahadin can force the target to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or bleed for the next 1 minute. (A bleeding target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or take an additional 1d6 slashing damage. On a success or upon receiving magical healing, the target is no longer bleeding.)
<p><strong><em>Chain.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (1d6 + 6) slashing damage, and Rahadin can force the target to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. If the target fails by 5 or more, it also falls prone.
<p><strong><em>Haunt.</em></strong> Rahadin forces a creature he can see within 30 feet to succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage and be frightened and deafened by shrieking souls until the start of his next turn.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Deathly Choir.</em></strong> Each creature within 10 feet of Rahadin that isn't protected by a <em>mind blank</em> spell must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also frightened until the start of Rahadin's next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Swift Step.</em></strong> Rahadin takes the Dash or Disengage action.
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Rahadin can take up to three reactions per round, though no more than one per turn. If an effect or condition would prevent him from taking reactions, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Rahadin can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting him. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Parry.</em></strong> Rahadin adds +5 to his Armor Class against one melee or ranged attack that would hit him or to the result of a failed Dexterity saving throw, or takes no damage from <em>magic missile</em> this turn. If he causes a melee attack to miss in this way, he can then immediately use an additional reaction, if available, to use his Riposte against the attacker.</p>
<p><strong><em>Riposte.</em></strong> When an enemy misses Rahadin with a melee attack, he can use his reaction to move up to his speed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of that enemy without triggering opportunity attacks. He can then immediately make an attack with <strong><em>Thorn</em></strong> or <strong><em>Chain</em></strong> attack against that enemy with advantage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Amulet of Ravenloft (1/day, Castle Ravenloft only).</em></strong> When Rahadin is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, he can use his reaction to end all effects currently affecting him, and use the <em>Amulet of Ravenloft</em> (see below). If he was reduced to 0 hit points, he drops to 1 hit point instead and suffers an internal injury as described in <span class="citation">Lingering Injuries (Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 272)</span>. He can then move up to his speed without triggering opportunity attacks.</p>
