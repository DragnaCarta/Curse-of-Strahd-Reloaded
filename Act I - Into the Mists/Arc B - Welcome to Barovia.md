In this arc, the players travel to the gloomy village of Barovia, which has been ravaged by death and despair in the wake of Strahd’s revival. When a disguised wereraven guides them to the Blood of the Vine Tavern, they meet Ismark, the eldest child of the village’s recently deceased burgomaster. 
>>>>>>> f5eb5dde98eed9634c2c79ea7d05aa8427a327a9

In exchange for food, shelter, information, and assistance against Strahd, Ismark asks the players to escort his sister Ireena—a target of Strahd's interest—to St. Andral's Church in the walled town of Vallaki to the west, where he believes she will be safe. Ismark is soon approached by "Mad Mary," a villager whose daughter, Gertruda, has recently left the village in search of her betrothed.

If the players agree to help him, Ismark escorts them to the Burgomaster's Mansion. There, Ireena insists on a burial for her father before departing, which can be performed at dawn with the aid of the village's priest, Father Donavich. As the players rest in the mansion, they receive a shared dream from the Vistani seer Madam Eva, who warns them that they are in grave danger and invites them to journey to her tent at Tser Pool Encampment to learn their fates.

Upon delivering the Burgomaster's coffin to the church the following dawn, the players can meet Doru, Father Donavich's son, who Strahd transformed into a vampire spawn as punishment for his rebellion. The players then face a choice: Will they destroy Doru, as Father Donavich requests—or spare him?

# B1. Old Svalich Road
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 2: Area A.</em></span>

The journey from [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act I - Into the Mists/Arc A - Escape From Death House#A3. Outside Death House|the tower]] to [[#B2. Gates of Barovia]] is nineteen-and-a-half miles long and takes six-and-a-half hours.

This scene largely unfolds as described in <span class="citation">Old Svalich Road (p. 33)</span>. However, shortly before the end of the players' seventh hour of travel, read: 

<div class="description">
<p>Heavy mists roll in across the road, creeping between the weather-worn trees like gnarled, ghostly fingers. The air carries an unnatural chill, and the hush of silence falls over the woods like a burial shroud.</p>
<p>As you walk, something catches your eye—a hunched silhouette in the fog, watching silently from the underbrush. Then, as quickly as it came, it vanishes.</p>
</div>

Pause briefly to allow the players to interject. If they do not, proceed to read the following:

<div class="description">
<p>Your footsteps quicken on the path, boots squelching in the wet brown mud. Gray-tinged light filters weakly through the treetops—and then darkens, an enormous avian shadow overhead briefly blocking out the day. It disappears, leaving not even a stir to the air in its wake.</p>
<p>Not moments pass before the daylight blinks out once again—this time, by a reptilian silhouette that soars across the heavens, batlike wings spread wide. It, too, plunges into the mists, devoured by the fog as dozens of tiny, birdlike shadows flit among the ancient branches far above. The birds' silhouettes follow the dragon's into the mist, and silence falls once more.</p>
<p>More visions come, fleeting and ephemeral, like whispers on the wind. A tall, slender figure looms in the darkness, feathered wings spreading elegantly from its back before it, too, melts into the shadows. In the distance, a broad-shouldered silhouette lurks among the moss-covered trunks, the shadow of an axe across its shoulder as it slowly curls a clawed, swollen hand. It hold your gaze for a moment, then fades back into the fog from whence it came.</p>
<p>A final figure—a tall, cloaked silhouette sitting atop a horse whose shadowed mane seems to ripple like flames—flickers in the fog betwixt three ancient yews. It seems to appraise you, its presence palpable even from a distance—and then a roll of distant thunder echoes across the skies. Before you can even blink, the figure is gone, the forest falling silent once more.</p>
</div>

These silhouettes depict, in order: Madam Eva, the Roc of Mount Ghakis, Argynvost, the Keepers of the Feather, the Abbot, Izek Strazni, and Strahd von Zarovich. The figures are illusions of the mists, and bear no deeper bond to the individuals they represent.

When the last silhouette disappears, the mists part on the road ahead, revealing [[#B2. Gates of Barovia]].

# B2. Gates of Barovia
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 2: Area B.</em></span>

This scene unfolds as described in <span class="citation">Gates of Barovia (p. 34)</span>.

The journey from the Gates of Barovia to [[#B3. Svalich Woods]] is one-quarter mile long and takes five minutes.

# B3. Svalich Woods
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 2: Area C.</em></span>

This scene begins as described in <span class="citation">Svalich Woods (p. 34)</span>. However, when the players find the corpse of Dalvan Olensky, he is not holding a crumpled envelope, and his clothes appear to have been torn by brambles and thorns, rather than claw marks. He doesn't appear to have any visible wounds, but a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals that he died of exhaustion.

Instead of the envelope, Dalvan is now holding an old, tarnished copper compass. While it remains close to the edge of the Barovian valley, its needle trembles strangely even when held still.

Dalvan's hand holding the compass is splayed out in the direction of a nearby tree, which bears thirteen tally marks and an arrow that points deeper into the woods, along what seems to be a well-traveled footpath.

> [!lore]+ **What Happened to Dalvan?**
> 
> In the wake of Strahd's attack on the village of Barovia, one of the survivors—a young man named Dalvan Olensky—was overcome with terror and despair.
> 
> Determined to find a way free from Barovia, Dalvan traveled to the Vistani encampment at Tser Pool, seeking out the reputed Vistani seer Madam Eva. There, Madam Eva read his future in the Tarokka cards, and drew the Horseman—a card that predicted that he would die in the Barovian valley.
> 
> Panicked, Dalvan returned to the village of Barovia under cover of night, stole a horse and compass, and set off for the eastern road out of Barovia. When the Svalich Road seemed to end, Dalvan delved into the woods, crossing through the mist and reemerging on the opposite side of the road.
> 
> A terrified, desperate, and delirious Dalvan repeated the loop thirteen times, his stolen horse expiring of exhaustion halfway through. It wasn't long before Dalvan succumbed to the effects of the Barovian fog as well—though not before inscribing his own epitaph in the form of the carving on the fourth tree.
> 
> Madam Eva regrets Dalvan's fate—but as the avatar of the Seeker, she is bound to read the future when asked, and knows that no efforts to escape can unravel a future that she has foreseen.

> [!info]+ **Dalvan's Compass**  
> Like all compasses in Barovia, Dalvan's compass behaves strangely as it approaches the vicinity of the edge of the Barovian valley—such as by Yester Hill in [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Act III - The Broken Land/Arc K - The Stolen Gem]] or toward the peak of Mount Ghakis in [[Arc T - The Amber Temple]]. Because there is no true "magnetic north" beyond the Mists that encircle Barovia, the needle of a compass that approaches the edge of the valley begins to tremble and eventually spin wildly the closer it gets. (This strange behavior ends when the compass is removed from the edge of the valley.)

If the players follow the footpath in the direction of the arrow, they soon come to a second tree, which bears another thirteen tally marks and an arrow that points further along the direction of the footpath. The edge of the footpath here bears the corpse of a **horse**, which is in a similar state of decay to Dalvan's.

If the players continue to follow the footpath in the direction of the arrows, they come to a third tree, which bears another thirteen tally marks and an arrow that points further along the direction of the footpath, which visibly vanishes into a wall of impenetrable fog.

The fog is part of the Mists that surround and entrap Barovia. If the players brought Dalvan's compass with them, the needle is now spinning wildly in circles.

If the players follow the footpath through the fog, they emerge after 2d4 minutes in an unfamiliar portion of the Svalich Woods. Each time the players emerge from the wall of fog around Barovia, they must make a DC 5 Constitution saving throw or take 1 level of exhaustion, as the fog saps their energy and drains their life force. (The DC increases by 5 each time that the players pass through the fog again.)

Upon emerging from the fog, the players can see a fourth tree, which bears another thirteen tally marks an an arrow that points further along the direction of the footpath. In addition, the fourth tree appears to bear a carving and has an object protruding from its trunk. If the players inspect it, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Someone has stabbed an old dagger in the trunk of this old, gnarled tree. Beside it lies a rough carving of a figure atop a horse, just above two sets of rough-hewn words: </p>
<p>"THE HORSEMAN RIDES. </p>
<p>"THE SEER SPOKE TRUE."</p>
</div>

If the players follow the footpath in the direction of the arrow, they find that it crosses the Svalich Road before returning to the location of Dalvan's corpse. 

If the players then leave Dalvan's corpse and return, they find that both his and the horse's remains have vanished.

# B4. Barovian Overlook
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 2: Area D.</em></span>

The players emerge from the Svalich Woods one mile and twenty minutes after departing Dalvan's corpse. When they do, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The dark woods fall away, revealing a misted, gloomy valley dotted with thick clouds of fog. </p>
<p>Rolling thunderclouds cast a gray pall over the land below, no sun visible in the cold, grey light. Evergreen trees climb the sides of the mountains that enclose the valley. To the north rises a stony mount with tufts of trees; to the south, a snow-capped peak with rugged slopes towers imperiously above the land below.</p>
<p>The muddy road continues on ahead, passing through yellowed grasses and farmland until it reaches a small, humble settlement hunkered down in the earth. Alongside the road, a river flows as clear as a blue winter sky through the valley. </p>
<p>Far above the village looms a dark, twisted castle, standing alone atop a pillar of sheer stone. For an instant, a distant spear of lightning crackles, illuminating the towering keep in harsh lights and shadows—and then a thick bank of fog rolls in, concealing the village and castle from view.</p>
</div>

The journey from here to the outskirts of the village is two miles long and takes forty minutes.

# B5. The Village of Barovia
## B5a. The Raven's Guidance
This scene largely unfolds as described in <span class="citation">Approaching the Village (p. 41)</span>. However, modify the description as follows:

<div class="description">
<p>As dusk begins to fall, plunging the overcast skies into a dull, darkened gloom, the outskirts of the village come into clearer view. A wide, dirt trench surrounds the settlement, five feet across and just as deep, with hundreds of of sharpened wooden stakes thrusting up like jagged teeth from the earth within. Up ahead, beside a tall heap of charred wood, the road continues over a makeshift wooden bridge, the muddy ground beyond giving way to slick, wet cobblestones.</p>
<p>Remnants of wooden barricades stand haphazardly along the streets. Some appear to be partially dismantled, with planks, logs, and simple tools piled nearby. The structures around them bear scorch marks and gashes, and several buildings show partially collapsed roofs or walls, allowing the cold, creeping fog to drift silently inside.</p>
<p>The tall shapes of village dwellings stand above the rest, looming out of the dense fog that clings to the earth. Though flickers of silhouettes, illuminated by candlelight, occasionally drift across the dark windows above, not a sound cuts the silence save for the quiet flapping of wings.</p>
</div>

The flapping is made by a raven with blue-tipped wings, which perches atop one of the houses flanking the street. This raven is Muriel, a disguised **wereraven** and member of the [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Chapter 2 - The Land of Barovia/Lore of Barovia#Factions#Keepers of the Feather|Keepers of the Feather]].

Once noticed by the players, Muriel caws and takes off once more into the air, attempting to lead them through the misty streets to the Blood of the Vine tavern, where she perches atop its sign.

The heap of charred wood is a pyre the villagers used to burn the bodies of the undead that attacked the village. The earth beneath it is scorched and choked with ash, and an assortment of burned bones, shredded armor, and broken weapons can be found on and around it.

The players do not encounter Morgantha, the **night hag** peddler, while exploring the village of Barovia. (They will meet her later on the Old Svalich Road instead.)

> [!lore]+ **What Barovians Know: The Rebellion & The Siege**  
> Residents and recent refugees from the village of Barovia, as well as the Vistani of Tser Pool and Vallaki, know the following information about Doru's rebellion and Strahd's ensuing siege:
> 
> * Just over three months ago, the priest's son, Doru, led a rebellion against Castle Ravenloft. Many of the village's youth followed him, swayed by his promises that the vampire's death would return sunlight to the valley and banish the Mists.
> * Doru and his followers never returned. Instead, shortly after his rebellion departed, an elf named Rahadin rode to the village and warned that the villagers had one hundred days to make peace with the Morninglord before Strahd's wrath fell upon them.
> * Some Barovians fled for Vallaki, but most others remained, persuaded by the words of Ismark Kolyanovich—the son of Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich—who vowed to lead them in defending their homes.
> * When the hundred days were up, dozens and dozens of undead laid siege to the village, returning to attack each night. They were led by a strange, pale undead that seeped a reddish mist, its victims becoming undead like the others.
> * After several days of fighting, a particularly brutal attack left dozens of villagers dead or wounded, including Burgomaster Indirovich. The villagers aren't sure why, but Strahd's forces withdrew shortly thereafter.
>   
>  Residents of Vallaki and Krezk know only that a rebellion occurred and failed, and that Strahd laid waste to the village of Barovia in his counterstroke. Most blame the villagers of Barovia for reawakening Strahd, whose emergence has plunged the valley once more into darkness.

## B5b. The Blood of the Vine Tavern
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 3: Area E2.</em></span>

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">Blood of the Vine Tavern (p. 43)</span>. However, insert the following at the beginning of this area's description:

<div class="description">
<p>An old, chipped stone statue stands at the center of this town square, depicting a man wearing leather armor and holding a sword.</p>
</div> 

The statue bears a weather-worn plaque at its base. It reads: "ISMARK ANTONOVICH THE GREAT. Burgomaster of Barovia. Bane of Vampires. 618—662 B.C." ("B.C." stands for "Barovian Calendar.")  
![[dnd/strahd-reloaded/images/Ismark the Great.png]]

### Entering the Tavern
Instead of Alenka, Mirabel, and Sorvia—the three Vistani found here in the original module—Arik is the sole owner and proprietor of the tavern. Alenka, Mirabel, and Sorvia are merely patrons, visiting from Tser Pool to drink and gather news. 

When the players enter, these Vistani eye them with brief interest, but soon return to their drinks, departing the tavern soon after. (Alenka and Mirabel return to Tser Pool. Sorvia, a spy for Strahd, travels to Castle Ravenloft to report that new outsiders have entered Barovia.)

As the PCs speak with Arik, Ismark approaches, offers to pay for their drinks, and invites them to his table. He notes that the players appear to be newcomers to Barovia, apologizes for the state of the village, and asks how they've come to arrive in the valley. "You must have a thousand questions," he says sympathetically. "I'd be glad to answer as many as I can."

![[Ismark.png]]

> [!profile]+ **Profile: Ismark Kolyanovich**
> 
> **Roleplaying Information**  
> ***Resonance.*** Ismark should inspire flattery with his genuine interest and empathy for the players, sympathy for his guilt and desperation, endearment for his anxiety to step beyond his ancestor's shadow, and gratitude for his friendliness and aid.
> 
> ***Emotions.*** Ismark most often feels concerned, guilty, friendly, melancholy, defiant, hopeful, desperate, and grateful.
> 
> ***Motivations.*** Ismark wants to keep his village and Ireena safe, keep his father's memory alive, and one day match his ancestor's legacy.
> 
> ***Inspirations.*** When playing Ismark, channel Jon Snow (*Game of Thrones*), Faramir (*Lord of the Rings*), and Trevor Belmont (*Castlevania*).
> 
> **Character Information**  
> ***Persona.*** To the world, Ismark is a courageous, reliable, and compassionate leader. To those he trusts, Ismark is a self-doubting, struggling warrior desperate to keep his loved ones safe. Deep down, Ismark worries that he will never live up to his ancestor's deeds—and fears that he has already irreparably failed.
> 
> ***Morale.*** In a fight, Ismark would first seek to mediate the parties' conflict, but would gladly draw his sword—and even fight to the death—if he believed that he was fighting for something or someone worth protecting.
> 
> ***Relationships.*** Ismark is the adoptive brother of Ireena Kolyana, and the great-grandson of Ismark the Great.

### Drinks with Ismark
As the players drink, [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] can share the the village's recent history, as well as most of the information in <span class="citation">Roleplaying Ismark (p. 43)</span> and <span class="citation">Barovian Lore (p. 26)</span>. However, Ismark doesn't mention a "mad wizard," and he doesn't suggest that the Vistani serve Strahd.

Ismark can also share the following information:

* The players have entered the land of Barovia, a realm surrounded by deadly fog and ruled by Strahd von Zarovich, a powerful vampire who slumbered in Castle Ravenloft until recently.
* Outsiders are occasionally spirited into Barovia by the mists. (Ismark has no knowledge of Death House, but vaguely remembers tales of unorthodox ways by which travelers have come to the valley.) There is no escaping Barovia once an outsider has entered it.
* The village of Barovia was recently decimated by a siege from Strahd's undead forces. While the undead were dispatched, the village suffered heavily, and many Barovians fled to Vallaki, a fortified town to the west. Many are still missing, and Ismark has had to dispatch several search parties across the nearby woods in search of survivors.
* All Barovians call Strahd "the Devil," fearing that speaking his name gives him power and draws his attention. (This is a myth.) Ismark is unsure whether he believes this, but warns the players that Strahd's spies are thought to be always watching— bats, wolves, and even human servants, including some among the Vistani. 
* St. Andral's Church in Vallaki is said to be hallowed ground, protecting its congregants from vampires and other undead. Ismark hopes to bring his sister, Ireena there, but is currently unable to due to his duties as his father's successor. 

If the players ask why Ismark hopes to bring Ireena to St. Andral's Church, he first swears them to secrecy. He then shares, in a hushed voice, that a vampire from Castle Ravenloft has haunted the grounds around their home in recent days. "I think the creature caught sight of her during the siege," he says, quietly. "I didn't want to panic the village, but I'm concerned that Barovia is no longer safe for her." (Ismark admits that the vampire is Strahd if confronted, but otherwise makes no mention of the vampire's identity.)

If the players ask about the statue outside the tavern, Ismark can share the following information:
 
* In life, Ismark Antonovich, also known as Ismark the Great, was a mighty warrior and the burgomaster of the village of Barovia. In his prime, he fought scores of vampires and other undead left behind when Strahd vanished from public view. He eventually died defending a group of trappers from a dire wolf attack at the age of 44, and the statue outside was erected in his honor. 
* Ismark Antonovich was Ismark Kolyanovich's great-grandfather. Ismark's father gave him that name in the hopes that he would one day become a great warrior.

Ismark doesn't believe that the players will be able to find either answers or protection in the village of Barovia, but suggests that they might find both in the town of Vallaki to the west. In the meantime, he is glad to offer the players room and board at his own home. (The Blood of the Vine Tavern doesn't have rooms for rent.) 

If the players indicate an interest in traveling to Vallaki, he asks if they would allow Ireena to accompany them, escorting her to St. Andral's Church in Vallaki.

> [!warning]+ **Clarifying Expectations**
> 
> *Curse of Strahd: Reloaded* is a campaign about heroes. It's also a campaign about making allies, and the bonds and strength that grow from those alliances.
> 
> As such, while Ireena is not an essential NPC to the campaign, a party that declines Ismark's request likely has mismatched expectations with the type of campaign you plan to run. If the players refuse to escort Ireena to Vallaki, pause the game and check in with them to clarify and confirm expectations. If the players are still reluctant to bring Ireena with them, ask questions and discuss the issue further before resuming the game.

### Bildrath's Fury
Shortly after Ismark begins answering the players' questions, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Something slams against a nearby table—and the sound draws your attention to a man sitting not far away, his clenched fist twitching against his table's wooden surface. He is squat, with greasy receding salt-and-pepper hair and a patched, well-worn coat. A scowl mars his face as he turns his dark eyes toward your group. "It's a fool's errand to put your faith in Ismark the <em>Lesser</em>," he rasps, eyes lingering upon each of you. "Best to seek better company, lest you wind up in the ground with the last fools that trusted him."</p>
</div>

The man is Bildrath Cantemir, the owner of <span class="citation">Bildrath's Mercantile (p. 43)</span>. If any of the players appear interested in speaking with him further, he invites them to sit at his table instead to "hear the real story of this bloody land." "The wine's shit," he grunts, shoving a pitcher of wine across the table, "but so's everything else."

If asked about Bildrath's statement about "the last fools that trusted him," Ismark winces. "He's right to hate me," he says quietly. "I asked the other villagers to stay and defend our homes. I was arrogant and foolish—I didn't appreciate just how powerful the Devil and his creatures were." He closes his eyes. "Now dozens of my friends and neighbors are gone—and I'm still here."

Should one or more of the players join him, Bildrath can share the following information:

* Just over three months ago, a pack of would-be "revolutionaries" marched off to Castle Ravenloft to "slay the vampire." Doru, the son of Father Donavich, the village priest, "filled their heads with fairy tales" of banishing the Mists and bringing the Sun back to Barovia.
* None of the revolutionaries ever came back. A few days later, a dusk-skinned elf came to the village and announced that the village had ninety days to make peace with the gods before the the lord of Castle Ravenloft—now awoken after a hundred years of slumber—exacted penance for their disobedience.
* Some villagers left. Many others wanted to leave. However, Ismark delivered a resounding speech in the village square before the statue of Ismark the Great, promising the villagers that those who remained would stand and defend their homes. "The audacity of the bastard," Bildrath sneers. "Standing in front of his great-grandfather's statue like he was worth a *tenth* of him."
* Bildrath wanted to leave—but his sister, Marta, and her husband, Dragomir, chose to stay with their son, Parriwimple, inspired by Ismark's words. Unwilling to leave his family, Bildrath stayed as well. "They figured they'd fight to defend what's theirs," he chokes out, blinking back tears. "Bloody *idiots* should've run, and never looked back."
* One hundred days after the elf delivered his proclamation, the undead came, swarming in hordes dozens strong from the Svalich Wood. The villagers fought back, defending the streets with barricades, swords, and arrows. "But the dead kept coming," Bildrath croaks. "And Marta—" He falls silent. (Bildrath lost Marta and Dragomir in the attacks, and blames Ismark for his failure to protect them.)

When he's regained his composure, Bildrath warns the players that the village is doomed, and likely all of Barovia with it. "There's no sun to bring back," he spits. "No escape from the mists. This is Hell, now and for all eternity. The sooner you lot accept that, the better off you'll be."

### Mary's Request
As the players' conversation with [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and Bildrath wind to a close, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The door to the tavern swings open once more, and a woman steps through, clad in a tattered and threadbare cloak. Her hair, tied into two loops that fall around her neck, is unkempt and tangled, and her wide eyes dart across the room with fearful energy.</p>
<p>Her gaze falls upon Ismark, and she steps shakily forward. As her features come into the light, you see that her face is pale, her eyes blotchy, with dried tears staining the flesh across her cheeks. Her voice is a ragged, haunting whisper as she says, "Master Kolyanovich—I apologize for interrupting you and your guests. But I haven't seen Gertruda since last night. I think she's gone to Vallaki—alone."</p>
</div>

The tavern immediately falls silent, and Ismark's eyes crease with worry. He gives Mary his condolences, and promises that he will organize a search party as soon as the last one returns. "If she doesn't make it to Vallaki, we'll find her—and bring her home safely."

As he does, Bildrath snarls and spits, "More empty promises, Kolyanovich?" He turns to the players, glowering. "Have you lot ever seen something so cruel?"

After the players have had a chance to speak, Bildrath insists, "No one can survive alone on those roads. The girl's gone, Mary. I'm sorry." Mary then bursts into tears.

Unless the players intervene, the following sequence then unfolds:

* Ismark stands up, pushing his seat away from the table. "That's enough, Master Cantemir," he growls.
* "You going to put me in my place, Master Kolyanovich?" Bildrath sneers. "Stop lying to the woman. The girl's as good as dead. We'll all be joining her soon enough."
* "There's always a chance," Ismark says heatedly. He swallows, and glances back at Mary, then at the players. "You might have given up on our people, Bildrath, but I haven't."
* Bildrath eyes Ismark, his hands curling into fists. After a long, lingering moment, he spits on the floor and exits the tavern without addressing Ismark or the players. The taproom remains deathly quiet, the silence broken only by Mary's choking sobs.

A few moments after Bildrath has left, if the players haven't already done so, Ismark turns to comfort Mary. "I promise you," he says, his voice breaking, "That I will do *everything* I can to see that Gertruda is brought home safely."

Once calmed, Mary wipes her eyes, thanks Ismark (and the players, if they comforted her), and departs the tavern.

> [!lore]+ **Where's Gertruda?**  
> Gertruda, despairing at the state of the village and determined to show the same courage as Doru, left Barovia for Vallaki the morning of the players' arrival, seeking to secure aid and supplies. However, if the players speak with the Barovian refugees or guards at Vallaki's gates in [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act I - Into the Mists/Arc C - Into the Valley#C11a. The Vallakian Gates|C11a. The Vallakian Gates]], they can learn that Gertruda never made it to Vallaki.
> 
> Instead, Strahd's black carriage found Gertruda along the Old Svalich Road. Recognizing him, a trembling Gertruda demanded he make good on his obligations as Barovia's liege-lord, providing for the safety and repairs the village so desperately needed. Impressed by her audacity and courage, Strahd invited her to Castle Ravenloft to discuss the matter further—and she has remained there ever since.

## B5c. The Burgomaster's Mansion
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 3: Area E4.</em></span>

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">Burgomaster's Mansion (p. 44)</span>. However, Kolyan's corpse still bears the wounds that killed him: a deep gash on his forehead, and multiple lacerations across his chest. Additionally, Ireena wears a thick red scarf to cover the marks of Strahd's teeth on her neck. (It was knitted for her by her late mother, Korina, who died of illness fourteen years ago.)

When the players arrive, Ismark directs them to knock on the door to "let Ireena know they're here." If they do, the following events then occur:

* The players hear the sound of footsteps approaching from the far side of the door. 
* A small peephole on the door opens, allowing a woman's eye to peer through.
* The peephole closes, and the players can hear someone unlocking a trio of locks.
* The door opens, revealing Ireena Kolyana on the opposite side. "Guests, Ismark?" she asks, raising an eyebrow.

![[Ireena.png]]

> [!lore] **The Peephole**  
> Like most homes in Barovia, Ireena and Ismark's front door is fitted with a peephole that allows them to identify visitors before opening the door. Barovian peepholes, however, are built internally like periscopes, with a pair of hidden tiny mirrors that bounce light to reach the viewer's eye—and thereby omit any vampires, whose reflections won't appear. (The toymaker Gadof Blinsky, of [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Act II - The Shadowed Town/Arc F - The Missing Vistana#F1. Blinsky Toys|Blinsky Toys]] in Vallaki, can share that these peepholes were first invented by the legendary inventor, Fritz von Weerg.)

### The Argument
[[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is surprised to see the players and assumes them at first to be merely travelers. If [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] informs her that they are to escort her to Vallaki, however, Ireena asks the players to excuse them and has a brief conversation with Ismark in private.

The entire conversation takes no more than five minutes. If the players do not choose to listen in, they are free to wander around the manor, talk amongst themselves, or simply wait for Ireena and Ismark to finish.

The players can eavesdrop on this conversation with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) check or a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>The murmurs from the next room are largely indistinct, obscured by the low groans of the old house's timbers. As you strain your ears, however, the siblings' words come slowly into focus.</p>
<p>Ireena's voice, sharp with indignation, pierces the silence. "You had no right, Ismark. You can't just decide to send me away, like I'm some kind of inconvenience! I'm Father's child as much as you, and our people need me to rebuild. You need me too!"</p>
<p>Ismark's reply is measured, though laced with an unmistakable note of worry. "The Devil still has his sights set on you—and even if we don't believe the legend about women with red hair, others might. Barovia just isn't safe for you anymore."</p>
<p>A snort of defiance echoes from the other side of the thin wooden partition. "I am no coward, Ismark, and I will not abandon our friends and neighbors in their hour of need."</p>
<p>There's a pause. Then, Ismark says, quietly, "Gertruda left the village last night. Alone."</p>
<p>You hear a ragged breath from Ireena's direction. "<em>Why?</em>"</p>
<p>"Her mother thinks she went to Vallaki," Ismark murmurs. "I don't know if she went for help, or to be away from the village—but the people here aren't the only ones who need your help."</p>
<p>There's a long, suffering silence. Then—</p>
<p>Ismark seems to hesitate, his words slightly fumbled. "I'm not asking you to abandon them. But there are others who need your help. Think about our neighbors who fled for Vallaki. They need guidance, advocacy—and perhaps a leader to bring them home one day."</p>
<p>There is a long pause. Ireena's voice is low when she finally speaks—barely even audible. "I still don't like it."</p>
<p>Ismark's response is quiet. "It's your choice. I can't take that away from you. But after losing Father, I can't … I can't bear the thought of losing you too."</p>
<p>The silence that follows is palpable, weighted with unspoken emotions. Finally, Ireena's voice breaks it, fragile and quiet. "I will go. If only for you. And only if we bury Father first—together."</p>
</div>

Ismark and Ireena emerge a few moments later. A player with a passive Wisdom (Insight) score of 12 or more notices that both have blotchy, red eyes, as if from crying.

[[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] then asks the players if they will assist him and Ireena in transporting their father's remains to the local church shortly before daybreak the following morning, so that he can be buried at dawn, as the faith of the Morninglord requires, before they depart. (Ireena will not willingly leave Barovia before this is done.) If they agree, Ireena and Ismark are both vocally grateful.

### Settling In
[[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] soon departs to gather a search party to locate Gertruda—one that he clearly fears will be in vain. As he does, [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] offers to help the players get settled in, setting them up in the mansion's two guest bedrooms and providing them with basic supplies.

If the players are looking to purchase additional supplies, Ireena offers them directions to Bildrath's Mercantile, but warns them not to mention Ismark's name. If the players ask her why Ismark is called "the Lesser," Ireena winces, and can share the following information:

* When Strahd's dusk elf servant—a cruel-looking man named Rahadin—delivered his warning three months ago, many Barovians were prepared to flee the village for Vallaki.
* Ismark, however, delivered a thundering and inspiring speech, invoking the memory of Lugdana and Ismark the Great to encourage them to stay and fight for their homes. Most did so.
* In the aftermath of Strahd's siege, many who had lost homes or loved ones in the battle blamed Ismark, who they felt had led them astray with his foolish fantasies of heroism and valor. They now call him "Ismark the Lesser" in mockery of his ancestry.
* No one feels more guilty or ashamed than Ismark himself, who has taken the weight of every death incurred in the siege on his own shoulders—and the weight of the rebuilding that followed.

If the players ask about Doru's rebellion, Ireena can share the following information:

* Doru was a friend of theirs, and the son of the village priest Father Donavich. He was a bright and cheery young man, with a sunny disposition and a zeal for everything he did.
* Just over three months ago, without warning, Doru announced a crusade against Castle Ravenloft, which he proclaimed would free Barovia from the mists and return sunlight to the valley. Over two dozen young Barovians accompanied him, as well as a scholar from distant lands named Alanik Ray, who had been staying as a guest at Ismark and Ireena's home for the previous several weeks while studying Barovian history and ecology. 
* Ireena doesn't recall much about Alanik, other than that he was a curious, somewhat intense man who kept to himself, took long walks into the Svalich Woods, and owned a pet monkey. She does remember, however, that he had a furious argument with Doru at one point, which confused her when he accompanied Doru to Castle Ravenloft shortly thereafter.

If the players ask about her parents, Ireena freely shares the following information while asking after the players' own families:

* Ismark and Ireena's parents were Kolyan Indirovich and Korina Targolova. Korina died of a sickness fourteen years ago, but Kolyan has done his best since then to continue raising both children alone. (The scarf Ireena wears is her last memory of her mother.)
* Kolyan, their father, was the one who found Ireena when she was a young girl, by the edge of the Svalich Woods near the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. Ireena doesn't remember anything of her past before then, but is grateful to her parents for taking her in and loving her dearly.

An hour later, when night has fully fallen, Ismark returns, weary and somber, but carrying a small bag in his hands. He joins Ireena to prepare a meal for the players: a stew of turnips and rabbit-meat, plus a somewhat stale loaf of bread. Ismark apologizes for the sparse meal, but the players can clearly see that the siblings' pantry is nearly bare, and can surmise that Ismark purchased the rabbit while out.

Over dinner, Ismark and Ireena ask the players about their interests and lives outside of Barovia. Ireena especially is fascinated by tales of the world beyond the mists. When the meal has finished, Ismark and Ireena retire to bed, leaving the players to their own devices.

When the players retire to their rooms, one of them finds a torn excerpt of *Van Richten's Guide to Vampires* by Dr. Rudolph van Richten sitting on a night table by the bed. This excerpt of the preface, which Van Richten tore from Doru's book in the midst of a furious argument, reads as follows:

<div class="description">
<p>In some shadowed corners of the world, the vampire reigns as a fearsome predator. Beyond mere bloodlust, these creatures are cursed with a range of abilities and weaknesses that make them as enigmatic as they are terrifying.</p>
<p>Their bodies are resilient to mundane weapons, shrugging off blows that would fell most mortals and regenerating even grievous wounds in a matter of moments. They move with unnatural grace, their senses sharply attuned to the whispers of the night. But it is in their supernatural abilities that their true horror lies. They can bend the will of others to their own, ensnaring friend and foe with but a gaze and a whisper. They can shift form with the ease of thought, becoming bats, wolves, or even a sinister mist that creeps beneath doorways and through cracks. And those their fangs kill become vampire spawn—ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood.</p>
<p>These creatures are not wholly invincible, however, possessing a tapestry of strengths woven with fatal weaknesses. Sunlight and running water can end their cursed existence, and wooden stakes through the heart will paralyze them as they sleep. They recoil from the sight of holy symbols, and cannot enter a residence without an invitation. They bear neither shadow nor reflection, and must return to their coffins, crypts, or graves to rest by day.</p>
<p>It is said that the bloodlust of these creatures is an unquenchable fire that burns within their undead hearts. The young and newly turned are slaves to this craving, often losing themselves in a frenzy at the mere scent of blood. But those who have walked the night for centuries, as well as those with indomitable focus and will, may learn to temper this fire. Those who do so possess the rare ability to conceal their monstrous nature, retracting and exposing their fangs at will—a sign that the monster within is held at bay, if only while the vampire allows.</p>
</div>

Ismark and Ireena don't recognize the excerpt, but Ireena recalls that Doru owned a copy of *Van Richten's Guide to Vampires*, which he loved. Neither is sure how this excerpt came to be in their guest room.

### Night at the Mansion
That night, as the players rest in the mansion, each of them—including those who do not ordinarily sleep—are drawn into a shared dream.

In the dream, the players find themselves within <span class="citation">Madam Eva's Tent (p. 37)</span>, seated across from an old crone—Madam Eva—whose face is concealed by the cowl of her cloak.

[[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Madam Eva|Madam Eva]] greets them and delivers the following message, pausing after every paragraph to allow the players to interject:

<div class="description">
<p>"Welcome, weary travelers," she says, "to my humble tent. You may call me Madam Eva. I have been expecting you. </p>
<p>"The winds of fate have brought you to this land, but do not be fooled—they are not winds of change, but winds of doom. I can see a shroud of darkness descending upon you. The lord of this land knows that you have trespassed into his domain, and he has set you in his sights. He is a creature of eternal hunger, and he will not rest until he has claimed your souls. </p>
<p>"But there is yet hope. I have been blessed with the gift of foresight, and I can see the twisting paths that lie ahead. Seek me, in my tent at Tser Pool, so that I may read the cards for you and decipher the strands of fate. Together, we may yet escape this darkness. </p>
<p>"But be warned: Time is running out, and the shadows are growing longer. Will you find me at Tser Pool?"</p>
</div>

If the players appear suspicious of Madam Eva's motives, she says, "Your fates are more than your own. My vision is obscured, but I can see that your futures are intertwined with the very destiny of the land itself. In conquering this shadow, you may yet find salvation for others as well—and, in failure, deliver damnation instead."

If the players ask for directions to Tser Pool, Madam Eva says only, "I am not far. Travel west. The path to my tent begins at a place of death."

Soon after Madam Eva delivers her warning, the "light" in the tent visibly dims, as though a shroud of darkened mist has descended upon it. In response, Madam Eva stirs and says, "He has sensed me. He cannot know of our meeting. Fly, travelers! I shall await you at Tser Pool!" 

The players then violently awaken, hearts beating fast and covered in sweat. Outside, the pale, ethereal light of the March of the Dead—as described in <span class="citation">March of the Dead (p. 48)</span> and just now beginning the march to Castle Ravenloft—is visible from the Old Svalich Road. The players can also see two **swarms of bats**—Strahd's spies—gathered on the eaves of a nearby house, watching silently from the darkness.

> [!lore] **Who Knows of Madam Eva?**  
> All Barovians know that the Vistani have a semi-permanent camp at Tser Pool. Only some, however—as well as most residents of the village of Barovia—know that the camp is led by the crone Madam Eva, who the Vistani claim to be a powerful fortuneteller and seer. Although few Barovians hold Madam Eva in high regard, some have made the journey to Tser Pool in the past, seeking her wisdom in matters of love, sickness, or death. 

### Waking Up
[[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] rouses the players shortly before dawn, gathering them to deliver the burgomaster's remains to Barovia's church. Ireena, already dressed and waiting in the foyer, greets them warmly as they descend the stairs.

If the players ask Ismark or Ireena about the March of the Dead, they share that the ghosts began appearing shortly after the failed revolt, when Strahd presumably first awoke. Until that time, the villagers had thought the so-called "March of the Dead" to be a myth from older times. If asked, Ismark awkwardly explains that the March is said to be a parade of outsiders that had become trapped in Barovia and sought, unsuccessfully, to slay the vampire Strahd.

If the players ask about Tser Pool, they can learn that a Vistani encampment is known to reside there. To reach Tser Pool, he says, they must first travel west from Barovia down the Old Svalich Road, then travel north from the River Ivlis Crossroads.

When the players are ready to depart, Ismark and Ireena ask them to assist in carrying Kolyan's coffin. The two siblings accompany the players to the church.

## B5d. The Barovian Church
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 3: Area E5.</em></span>

When the players arrive at the church with the burgomaster's body, [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is disturbed by the damage wrought to its walls and roof. As he knocks on the front door, calling for Father Donavich, read the following:

<div class="description">
<p>As Ismark's knock echoes through the cold air, a voice rings out from the darkened street: "He won't come out."</p>
<p>A hulking silhouette steps forward from the mist—a young man, tall and brawny. His shaggy brown hair falls messily across his face, and his crooked teeth glint in the moonlight. Though muscles ripple beneath his tunic, there's a lightness and immaturity to his posture that belies his strength and size. </p>
<p>The young man fidgets with the hem of his tunic as your eyes fall upon him. "Not since two weeks ago," he mumbles.</p>
</div>

The young man is Parriwimple, described further in <span class="citation">E1. Bildrath's Mercantile (p. 43)</span>. Despite the early hour, he's out for a walk. (He hasn't been able to sleep well since his parents died in the siege, though he's grateful to his uncle, Bildrath, for taking him in.)

> [!profile]+ **Profile: Parriwimple**
> 
> **Roleplaying Information**  
> ***Resonance.*** Parriwimple should inspire sympathy for the loss of his parents, endearment for his childlike mannerisms and optimistic perseverance, and flattery for his fascination with the players' exotic weapons and clothes.
>

> 
> ***Motivations.*** Parriwimple wants to help his friends and neighbors, take care of his Uncle Bildrath, and honor his late parents' memories.
> 
> ***Inspirations.*** When playing Parriwimple, channel Lenny Small (Of Mice and Men) and Forrest Gump (Forrest Gump).
> 
> **Character Information**  
> ***Persona.*** To the world, Parriwimple is a cheerful, simple-minded young man. To those he trusts, Parriwimple is a thoughtful, insightful, yet grieving orphan, desperate to move past his parents' deaths by proving useful to others.
> 
> ***Morale.*** In a fight, Parriwimple would hold up his hands and plead for peace. If ignored, however, he would swiftly use his strength to restrain any combatants—with righteous fury if defending his uncle Bildrath.
> 
> ***Relationships.*** Parriwimple is an orphan and the nephew of the general-store owner Bildrath Cantemir.

Parriwimple can share the following information with the players:

* Father Donavich used to be a kind and friendly man, always ready to share a word of wisdom or a warm crabapple pie with visitors. 
* Ever since the siege started, however, Donavich has shut himself inside the church and turned away visitors more often than not. When Parriwimple last saw him three days ago, Donavich looked like he hadn't slept or bathed in a week.
* Father Donavich hasn't worn his holy symbol (a bronze sunburst) since the rebellion, which Parriwimple considers odd. (Parriwimple always loved how the light would glint off of its surface, and adored hearing Donavich's son, Doru, tell stories of how the sun once shone in Barovia.)
* Parriwimple misses Doru, who left to lead the rebellion against Strahd three months ago alongside the stranger, Alanik. (Parriwimple also misses Alanik's pet monkey, which he loved to play with.) Despite his uncle telling him that Doru died at Castle Ravenloft, Parriwimple hopes that he somehow survived.

Parriwimple won't accompany the players inside of the church, but wishes them well and invites them to visit him at Bildrath's Mercantile before departing. 

### Inside the Church
This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">Church (p. 45)</span>. However, modify the descriptive text for <span class="citation">E5a. Hall (p. 45)</span> to remove Doru's scream: 

<div class="description">
<p>The doors open to reveal a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-long hall leading to a brightly lit chapel. The hall is unlit and reeks of mildew. Four doors, two on each side of the hall, lead to adjacent chambers.</p>
<p>You can see that the chapel is strewn with debris, and you hear a soft voice from within reciting a prayer.</p>
</div>

Doru does not cry out to his father when the players enter the chapel. Instead, when the players first approach the chapel, Donavich's prayers halt. Add the following line to the chapel's description in place of Doru's cry:

<div class="description">
<p>The sound of mumbled prayer stops, and a hoarse, tired voice rings through the chamber from the figure kneeling behind the altar. “I cannot offer the blessing you seek. Go, and leave this accursed place in peace.”</p>
</div>

> [!lore]+ **A Recent History of the Church**
> 
> Father Donavich was no supporter of Doru's march on Castle Ravenloft. A mild and soft-spoken man, Donavich feared that Doru would meet only his end beyond the walls of the keep. To keep his son safe, however, and as a token of his love, Donavich gave Doru his holy symbol, as well as his blessing.
> 
> Donavich's holy symbol, however, did little to protect his son. When Strahd began his siege on the village of Barovia two weeks ago, his undead forces were not alone: Strahd also sent Doru, now a freshly turned **vampire spawn**, to terrorize the church and torment his father. Donavich barely managed to lure and trap Doru in the undercroft, where he remains imprisoned still.
> 
> Since Doru returned, Father Donavich has been unable to cast any spells and no longer feels the Morninglord's presence when he prays. When Strahd sent Doru back to Barovia, he allowed Doru to continue wearing his father's holy symbol as a cruel joke. As a result, Donavich wrongly believes that Doru's undead nature has corrupted his symbol—and, therefore, his relationship with the Morninglord—and so prevented him from reaching the Morninglord's divine grace.
> 
> In fact, however, it is Father Donavich's own loss of faith that hinders him—a crisis that blinds him to an even starker truth. Donavich believes that his son, Doru, is dead, and that the **vampire spawn** trapped in the undercroft is a foul and profane beast that wears Doru's skin. He is mistaken: though his body is now undead, Doru's soul is very much alive.
> 
> Though he cannot ignore Strahd's direct commands, and though his thirst for blood weighs heavily on his thoughts and actions, Doru continues to fight bitterly against his own vampiric nature. Though he doesn't always succeed, it was this resistance that allowed his father to entrap him in the undercroft at all. When hope rises in him, Doru calls out to his father to release him, pleading for salvation and forgiveness. Donavich, however, has so far refused to respond.
> 
> Doru continues to wear his father's holy symbol, both to reassure himself that they will one day reconcile and to steel his will when the vampire's urges rise too strongly within. His ability to resist the call of blood has slowly grown since his imprisonment—but so too has his exhaustion, exacerbated by slow starvation. Now, Doru's sanity balances on a knife's edge, and a simple push could mean salvation—or damnation.

> [!profile]+ **Profile: Father Donavich**
> 
> **Roleplaying Information**  
> ***Resonance.*** Donavich should inspire sympathy for his sorrow and fears, pity for his separation from the Morninglord, endearment for his kindness and hospitality, and discomfort for his zealous condemnation of Doru's undead nature.
> 
> ***Emotions.*** In his current state, Donavich most often feels grief, guilt, exhaustion, compassion, and obsession. If reconciled with Doru, he most often feels hope, relief, gratitude, confusion, fear, and shame.
>

>

If he learns that Ismark and Ireena are with the players, Donavich acts more warmly toward them and apologizes for the chapel's state of disrepair. 

As the conversation unfolds, the following exchanges might occur:

* If Ismark, Ireena, or a player asks about burying the deceased burgomaster, Father Donavich informs them that he would be glad to oversee a burial, but that he cannot perform the holy rites that would sanctify Kolyan's remains. (Donavich is sorrowful to hear of Kolyan's death, and expresses his condolences for his passing.)
* If Ismark, Ireena, or a player notes the damage done to the church, Father Donavich informs them that it was caused by a **vampire spawn** that attacked amidst the siege—the undead husk of his son, Doru. (Both Ismark and Ireena are shocked and horrified to learn of Doru's fate, having believed he died at Castle Ravenloft.)
* If Ismark, Ireena, or a player informs him that Gertruda (Doru's betrothed) has gone missing, Father Donavich mourns her and murmurs a quiet prayer that the Morninglord keep and protect her soul.

If the players inquire further, Donavich can share the following information:

* When Doru set off for Castle Ravenloft, Father Donavich gave him his holy symbol of the Morninglord—a bronze sunburst on a leather cord—to keep him safe in the face of darkness. When Doru failed to return, however, Donavich feared the worst.
* Two weeks ago, as the siege was beginning, Doru returned to the church at midnight, now transformed into a **vampire spawn**. Donavich managed to lure Doru into the undercroft and trap him there.
* Ever since Doru returned, Donavich hasn't been able to cast spells or feel the Morninglord's presence. He believes that this is because Doru still has his holy symbol, and that Strahd's foul influence has corrupted Donavich's connection to the gods.
* Donavich believes that his son is dead, and that the creature that wears his skin is a mockery that must be destroyed.

Donavich knows that he can't defeat Doru and can't bear to see his son's face again. If the players are willing, however, Donavich asks them to descend to the undercroft, destroy Doru's body, and retrieve his holy symbol. In exchange, Donavich offers to complete the proper burial rites and to tell the players of a place where they can find safety from the Devil Strahd.

If the players agree, Donavich produces the key to the to the padlock in <span class="citation">E5d. Trapdoor (p. 45)</span> and allows them to enter. (Ismark remains upstairs with Ireena, reluctant to expose her to a vampire—even Doru—but promises the players that he will join them should Doru prove too dangerous for them to handle. A DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that he also appears too horrified by Doru's fate to face him directly.)

### Descent to the Undercroft
The undercroft is largely as described in <span class="citation">E5g. Undercroft (p. 47)</span>. However, modify the last sentence of the description as follows: 

<div class="description">
<p>Candlelight from the chapel above slips through the cracks, but there's no sign of any creature in the gloom.</p>
</div>

Doru, a **vampire spawn**, has used his ***spider climb*** feature to cling to the ceiling at the sound of the players' approach. A player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher automatically spots him in the darkened upper corner on the far side of the room. Otherwise, read the following after one round has passed.

<div class="description">
<p>A young man’s voice, strained and tired, echoes from the darkness above. “You’ve come to kill me, haven’t you?”</p>
</div>

Doru prefers to speak with the players from the safety of darkness, but won't refuse if the players command him to reveal himself. If he does, read the following:

<div class="description">
<p>From the darkness of the cross beams above, a figure unfurls itself like a moth from its cocoon, moving like a spider as it lowers itself slowly to the ground. As it comes into the faint light, the shadow resolves into the form of a young man, his youthful features strikingly reminiscent of Father Donavich.</p>
<p>His skin is ghostly pale, with dirt and grime streaked across his face. His clothes are ripped and worn, and his hair is an unkempt mess of tangles and knots. His eyes are red and bloodshot, his gaze darting from face to face. A leather cord hangs around his neck, holding a bloodstained bronze sunburst that rests against his chest. He swallows and licks his lips—and a pair of pointed fangs pokes through.</p>
<p>"If you want to kill me, I won't stop you," he says, his voice cracking. "But I just have one request first."</p>
</div>

> [!profile]+ **Profile: Doru**
> 
> **Roleplaying Information**  
> ***Resonance.*** Doru should inspire sympathy for his struggles against his vampiric nature, mild discomfort with his occasionally inhuman mannerisms, and endearment for his clear dedication to his father and Gertruda.
> 
> ***Emotions.*** Doru most often feels grief, guilt, shame, desperation, resignation, and hope.
> 
> ***Motivations.*** Doru wants to reconcile with his father and ensure Gertruda's safety.
> 
> ***Inspirations.*** When playing Doru, channel Theon Grejoy (Game of Thrones), Zuko (Avatar: The Last Airbender), Jesse Pinkman (Breaking Bad), and Steve Harrington (Stranger Things).
> 
> **Character Information**  
> ***Persona.*** To the world, Doru is a monstrous, bloodthirsty vampire spawn. To those he trusts, Doru is a broken, guilty man who is desperate to avoid hurting those he loves.
> 
> ***Morale.*** In a fight, Doru would seek to flee to avoid hurting anyone—but if his father or Gertruda were endangered, he would fight savagely to protect them.
> 
> ***Relationships.*** Doru is Father Donavich's son, Escher's former friend, and Gertruda's betrothed.

> [!info]+ **Doru Will Remember That**
> 
> When the players' conversation with Doru begins, secretly place a six-sided die on the table, with its top face showing a one. Each time the players antagonize or discourage Doru, increase the number on the die by one. Each time the players are encouraging or kind, decrease the number on the die by one. (The number can't go below zero or above six.)
> 
> If the players agree to perform Doru's experiment, roll a second six-sided die when the experiment begins. If the result on the second die is equal to or greater than the number on the first, Doru resists his vampiric addiction and the test ends successfully. If the result on the second die is less than the number on the first, however, Doru succumbs to his bloodlust and attacks the source of the blood.
> 
> For example, if the players antagonize Doru twice and offer no kindness or encouragement, the first die should show a three. If the second die rolls a one or a two, Doru attacks.

Doru's request is simple: to prove to himself that he can control his vampiric urges, he wants the players to expose him to the scent of fresh blood. If he can refrain from attacking for a full minute, he wants the players to tell Father Donavich that his son is still alive. If he can't, he wants the players to kill him. In either case, he won't stop the players from taking the holy symbol once the experiment is complete.

> [!abstract] **The Players Attack**  
> Doru doesn't fight to defend himself if attacked. Instead, he curls into a ball at the end of the room and pleads for the players to give him a chance—just one chance—to prove himself. If the players decline, Doru whimpers for his father to save him as he dies, though his pleas go unheard and unheeded.

Doru can also share the following information with the players if asked:

* As a child, Doru was enraptured by stories of the sun and the light and hope that it once brought to the valley. As he grew older, he learned swordsmanship from Ismark and studied the book *Van Richten's Guide to Vampires* to learn how to destroy the undead. He dreamed of one day destroying the Devil of Castle Ravenloft and bringing freedom to his people.
* Sixteen weeks ago, a foreign scholar calling himself Alanik Ray arrived in Barovia and rented a room in the burgomaster's manor. When an enormous undead dire wolf attacked a group of children who had strayed too far from the village, however, Doru alone saw "Alanik" fend it off with expert skill—and when the wolf knocked the hat off of "Alanik's" head, his appearance magically changed, revealing him to be the legendary vampire hunter Dr. Rudolph van Richten.
* Doru confronted him and insisted that Van Richten lead the village in revolt against Castle Ravenloft. Though Van Richten was reluctant at first, he eventually agreed—on the condition that Doru allow him to keep his disguise. Two days later, Doru, aided by a man named Escher—the village bard and Doru's oldest friend—had assembled more than two dozen fighters to march on the keep.
* With Van Richten's aid, the mob struck down any undead guards that tried to stand in their way. However, when they finally opened Strahd's crypt, Escher was nowhere to be found—and Strahd's coffin was empty. (If asked, Doru forcefully denies that Escher betrayed them.)
* Shortly thereafter, Strahd emerged from the shadows and attacked the mob with merciless force. Most of Doru's companions were slain. Doru himself was turned into a vampire spawn, and later learned that Escher had been as well. Doru doesn't know what happened to Van Richten, but was forced to confess the old man's identity when Strahd interrogated him later. 
* Doru spent nearly three months at Castle Ravenloft, during which Strahd repeatedly forced him to drink the blood of his former companions. Two weeks ago, Strahd commanded Doru to return to the church and his father. 
* Doru can't disobey Strahd's direct orders, and can feel his presence at all times. His vampiric bloodthirst is a constant distraction, and it's difficult to control his predatory urges and instincts. When he first returned to the church, he was almost grateful that his father had locked him in the undercroft, where he couldn't do any harm.
* Doru doesn't know if his soul or body can be saved, but he's kept his father's holy symbol to remind him of his faith and family, and to steel his will against the addictions of his new form. If not for that, he suspects that he would have lost control days or even weeks ago. (Doru doesn't know why Strahd allowed him to keep it, but suspects that Strahd viewed it as a form of ironic amusement.)

If the players ask about his argument with "Alanik," Doru admits, shamefacedly, that he forced Van Richten to accompany his rebels to the castle, threatening to march on Castle Ravenloft with or without Van Richten's help. (An enraged Van Richten ripped out the preface of Doru's copy of *Van Richten's Guide to Vampires*—which Doru bought from a Vistani caravan ten years prior—in order to make a point. "He warned me that faith and books meant nothing in the face of true evil," Doru murmurs. "I should have listened." Doru isn't sure what happened to the rest of the book.)

As the conversation continues, Doru might ask the players:

* whether Escher has been seen in the village, and
* whether Doru's betrothed, Gertruda, survived the siege.

If told that Gertruda has left the village alone for Vallaki—likely in a misguided effort to save Doru himself—Doru becomes visibly distraught, but hopes aloud that she made the journey safely. He asks the players to look out for her and help bring her home should they find her. Doru feels that he has earned his fate, but believes that Gertruda, a good and compassionate woman, deserves far better.

### Doru's Trial
If the players agree to fulfill Doru's request by exposing him to fresh blood, he asks them to remain silent while he resists—and to strike him down if he succumbs. When the trial begins, read the following:

<div class="description">
<p>Doru’s muscles tense and he squeezes his eyes shut. A few moments later, his nostrils flare, and a thin line of saliva begins to run down his lips. He whimpers, his clawed fingers flexing and twitching.</p>
<p>"When the shadows come,” he whispers, “I will not yield. Darkness is the destroyer, and temptation its weapon. I will face the night and its horrors and await the horizon. For in the light of the Morninglord's love, only light can remain."</p>
<p>Doru's voice shakes, his emaciated body trembling. One fist is clenched at his side, the other squeezing the bloodstained sunburst that lies across his neck.</p>
<p>"In the light of the Morninglord's love," he repeats, gasping for breath. "In the light of the Morninglord's love. Gertruda. Gertruda. ***Gertruda***—"</p>
</div>

If Doru succumbs to the bloodlust (see **Doru Will Remember That** above), he pauses, then attacks. Roll initiative.

Otherwise, if Doru successfully resists the bloodlust, read:

<div class="description">
<p>After what seems like an eternity, Doru's body finally relaxes. His tense muscles seem to uncoil, his breath grows steadier, and the look of strain fades from his face. His eyes remain closed a moment longer, then flutter open—and the fangs in his mouth slowly retract, leaving only an ordinary pair of canines behind.</p>
<p>"I have not yielded," he whispers hoarsely. "Not yet."</p>
</div>

Doru thanks the players and relinquishes the holy symbol without protest. If the players mention it, he is surprised to hear that his fangs have retracted, but recognizes the significance with humility and disbelief. (Doru has, after all, read *Van Richten's Guide to Vampires* many times.)

Doru warns the players that Strahd will likely take an active interest in newcomers to his land, and that they should therefore be careful. As a token of his gratitude, he provides the players with the location of a hidden weapons cache that Van Richten kept in case of emergencies. To reach it, the players must cross the River Ivlis Bridge and travel down the Old Svalich Road three hundred paces south into the woods, until they arrive at an ancient oak tree. They'll find the cache nestled in a hollow beneath the tree's roots.

Before the players depart, Doru asks them once more to tell Father Donavich that his son is still alive. If asked to accompany them upstairs, he declines to do so. "I have sinned with my hubris, and this is my penance," he says softly. "I will leave this prison only when my father allows."

### The Burial
If the players return to Father Donavich with his holy symbol in hand, he accepts it with gratitude.

If the players tell Father Donavich that they killed Doru to obtain the symbol, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Donavich's eyes well up with tears as he clasps the symbol in his hands, holding it so tightly his knuckles begin to turn white. A strangled sob escapes him as he sinks to his knees, cradling the sunburst like an infant. </p>
<p>"My boy—my dear, precious boy," he murmurs, his voice barely above a whisper. "May the Morninglord forgive me for what I've done—and for what I couldn't do." </p>
<p>He swallows and his face tenses, his expression growing as hard as stone. "It had to be done. For his sake—and ours."</p>
</div>

Otherwise, if the players spared Doru and relay his final message, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Donavich stumbles back as if he's been struck, his face pale and his eyes wide with shock. For a moment, he simply stands there, silent—and then the silence is broken by a pained noise, a cross between a gasp and a sob, as he clutches the symbol to his chest. </p>
<p>His eyes glisten as he runs a trembling hand through his hair, a myriad of emotions playing across his face in quick succession: disbelief, rage, grief, shame, and—finally—hope. He sags against a nearby pew, his body shaking with exertion. </p>
<p>"My boy," he chokes out. "He's—he's still my boy?" </p>
</div>

Once he's received his holy symbol, Father Donavich gladly agrees to conduct Kolyan's burial.

The cemetery is as described in <span class="citation">E6. Cemetery (p. 48)</span>. At night, it is watched by two **swarms of bats**—spies of Strahd's—who hang to the eaves of the church and the nearby mausoleums, watching the players.

Upon entering the cemetery, Donavich retrieves four shovels from a shed abuting the church and shares them with the players. When the grave is fully dug and dawn has begun, Donavich offers prayers to the Morninglord, asking for Kolyan's deliverance in the following refrain:

<div class="description" style="text-align: center;">
<p>O Morninglord</p>
<p>Lord of blessed light and patron of new beginnings</p>
<p>We commend into thy mercy and thy radiance Master Kolyan Indirovich</p>
<p>Now departed hence from us and gone evermore into your glory.</p>
<p>We beseech thee to grant unto him thy mercy and everlasting peace</p>
<p>As thou deliver'st him from this everlasting darkness into infinite light</p>
<p>From pestilence into growth</p>
<p>From shadow into day</p>
<p>And from death into new life.</p>
<p>Grant him entrance into Your land of light and joy</p>
<p>In the fellowship of thy saints</p>
<p>And the brilliance of thy presence</p>
<p>By Your will and grace.</p>
</div>

At the conclusion of Donavich's prayer, any players who wish to may offer words, prayers, or tributes of their own. If he has recovered his holy symbol, Donavich first casts *gentle repose* to sanctify Kolyan's remains. Donavich then directs the players to lower the coffin into the ground. 

With the burial concluded, Strahd's bats take off into the air, vanishing up into the mist surrounding the base of Castle Ravenloft.

Donavich takes the bats' presence as a bad omen. In a surprisingly lucid moment, he warns the players and Ismark of a Barovian superstition that young women with red hair often find that ill luck travels beside them, and asks if Ireena plans to remain in Barovia now that the Devil has awoken. If told that Ireena and the players intend to leave, Donavich suggests the Abbey of St. Markovia in Krezk as an eventual destination. He notes it was once a bastion of good, and may yet still offer some protection.

> [!lore] **Who Knows of the Abbey?**  
> All Barovians know that the Abbey of St. Markovia lies in the village of Krezk. Most outside of Krezk are unsure as to whether it still operates, though rumors abound that Strahd destroyed it long ago, leaving nothing more than ghosts to haunt its halls. A few Vallakians, including Father Lucian Petrovich of St. Andral's Church, know that the Abbey was reopened more than one hundred years ago, but none beyond Krezk know that the Abbey's current abbot is the same man who reopened its doors over a century ago. 

### Return to the Mansion
When the players return to the burgomaster's manor following the burial, [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] prepare a light breakfast while speaking with the players about their next steps. The conversation largely proceeds as follows unless redirected by the players:

* Ismark confirms that St. Andral's Church in Vallaki is Ireena's destination.
* Ireena asks the players about their destination or plans in Vallaki, as well as whether they expect to make any stops along the road there.
* If the players have mentioned their intent to visit Tser Pool, Ismark notes that the journey to Vallaki is more than a day's travel if the players plan to visit Tser Pool first, and that Ireena and the players will likely need to spend a night on the road. He recommends doing so at Tser Pool itself.
* If the players haven't mentioned their intent to visit Tser Pool, Ismark notes that the Svalich Road can be dangerous, and advises the players to set a waypoint to rest and recuperate along the way. (Better to be cautious, he says, than to rush into a more taxing journey than necessary.) He suggests Tser Pool as a potential waypoint.
* In either case, Ismark notes that Tser Pool is a bit under two hours' journey from Barovia. (Though some Vistani are rumored to be in league with Strahd, Tser Pool is known to be a safe place for travelers to spend the night, especially given the reputation of the Vistani leader, Madam Eva.)

Given the short distance to Tser Pool, Ireena tells the party that she'll be ready to leave at noon. Until then, the players are free to explore the village, shop at Bildrath's Mercantile, or otherwise pass the time.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
## B5e. Lugdana's Knoll
Approximately an hour before noon, [[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] quietly slips out of the mansion, walking to Lugdana's Knoll, a small, quiet hill to the north of Barovia. (The hill is named for the paladin Lugdana, who, according to legend, first met Burgomaster Ismark Antonovich the Great upon that hill.) 
>>>>>>> f5eb5dde98eed9634c2c79ea7d05aa8427a327a9

## B5e. Lugdanna's Knoll
Approximately an hour before noon, [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] quietly slips out of the mansion, walking to Lugdana's Knoll, a small, quiet hill to the north of Barovia. (The hill is named for the paladin Lugdana, who, according to legend, first met Burgomaster Ismark Antonovich the Great upon that hill.) 

Shortly before noon, if the players haven't been keeping track of her, [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]—who's currently briefing a pair of Barovian **scouts** regarding Gertruda's disappearance—notes Ireena's absence with minor concern and asks the players to find her and bring her home. 

Because Strahd and his servants have only visited at night, Ismark isn't notably alarmed by Ireena's absence, but still wants to see her brought home as quickly as reasonably possible. Ismark advises that the players check Lugdana's Knoll first—one of Ireena's favorite spots around the village—and provides brief directions to get there. 

If the players visit the knoll, read:

<div class="description">
<p>As you pass through the sea of tall grasses north of the village, a gentle knoll rises before you, bordered on the far side by the clutches of the dark Svalich Wood. Plants with white, feathery flowers and a sweet, earthy scent seem to dance amidst the grass atop the hill, their leaves rustling in a whispering wind.</p>
<p>A lonely tree stands atop the hill, its gnarled branches reaching skyward like outstretched arms. Beneath its shade kneels a female figure, her gaze fixated upon the ground.</p>
</div>

The figure is Ireena, who has donned her chestplate and rapier. As the players approach, they can see that she is using a trowel to dig a hole in the earth between the tree's roots. Ireena, fixated upon her work, doesn't notice the players until they call out to her or otherwise enter her field of view.

Ireena greets the players with warmth, though with some embarrassment for having driven them to come search for her. She shares freely that she is digging for a small wooden chest that she and her mother, Korina Targolova, buried here before her mother's death fourteen years ago—a coffer whose contents she hopes to take as a keepsake when she departs for Vallaki, given that she doesn't know when, if ever, she'll be able to return home.

If allowed to finish unearthing the chest, Ireena opens it, revealing its contents. The chest contains a silver bracelet set with gemstones, a pressed aster flower, a wooden charm in the shape of the yarrow flower on a leather cord, and a handkerchief with floral patterns.

The flower (which Ireena found and her mother pressed), charm (which Ireena's mother wore as an apprentice to the town's healer), and handkerchief (which Ireena's mother helped her to sew) are all mementos of Ireena's childhood with her mother. The bracelet is an item that Ireena was found carrying when Kolyan found her in the Svalich Wood, which Korina kept as a memento of their "miracle child" after she learned that she could bear no more children.

The bracelet holds no sentimental value for Ireena, and she doesn't remember why she was carrying it when Kolyan first found her, or where she obtained it. She offers it to the players as a gift for their agreement to escort her to Vallaki, as compensation for their trouble.

The silver bracelet, which is tarnished and clearly hundreds of years old, is worth 100 gp and bears an intricate pattern of the moon and stars along the exterior, with a moonstone gem embedded at the center of the moon and five lapis-lazuli serving as the stars. On the inside of the bracelet, in tiny, elegant script, the following message is engraved in Common: "Tatyana: May you find your path, and may you find light even in the darkest places—Mother & Father."

Ireena doesn't know who Tatyana is. (Unbeknownst to Ireena, the bracelet was a gift from Tatyana Federovna's parents on Tatyana's eighteenth birthday. It was lost in the Svalich Wood when Tatyana leapt to her death from the Castle Ravenloft overlook.)

After sharing the items in the chest, Ireena apologizes to the players. "I'm not certain if my brother has been entirely forthright to you," she says, not meeting their eyes. "But—perhaps it's easier if I show you." She then removes her scarf, revealing the bite scars upon her neck. She can then share the following information:

* The creature hunting her is none other than the Devil of Castle Ravenloft himself—and he has twice visited her in recent days, drinking her blood before vanishing into the night. 
* The first night, Strahd charmed her and Ismark at the front door and commanded them to invite him inside. The second night, when they locked and barred the door, Strahd came to her bedroom window instead. (Strahd's visits are why the siblings have boarded up their windows and installed the locks on the door—for fear he might find his way inside once again.)

"I don't know why he hasn't killed me or turned me," Ireena says, gritting her teeth as her hands curl into fists. "I don't know if this is some kind of sick game he's playing, or if he just likes to see people suffer."

The anger leaves her as she adds, somberly, "But now you know the truth." Her voice chokes as she adds, "They say women with red hair bring bad luck. I'm sorry—I never wanted to bring any to you." (She is grateful for any reassurances the players might offer.)

Ireena gladly returns to the mansion with the players, or returns on her own shortly after noon if the players failed to find her. She then retrieves a packed traveling bag from her room.

When the players are ready to leave, Ireena bids Ismark a heartfelt farewell and sets off on the road.

**_Milestone_**. Burying the Burgomaster completes a story milestone. If the players depart Barovia with Ireena accompanying them, award each player 400 XP. If Doru successfully passed his test of will, award each player an additional 100 XP.

## B5f. Bildrath's Mercantile
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 3: Area E1.</em></span>

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">Bildrath's Mercantile (p. 43)</span>. However, instead of selling items for ten times the price listed in the _Player's Handbook_, Bildrath sells them for only twice the price, citing the recent economic upheaval. (If any players were kind to him in the tavern, he instead sells those players items at the normal price listed in the *Player's Handbook*—a special deal, for them only.)

If [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is present, Bildrath glowers at him and instead raises his prices to five times the price listed in the _Player's Handbook_, spitefully claiming them to be a "special deal" for friends of the town's "great hero."

During the players' conversation with Bildrath, Parriwimple enters the room carrying a box of wares that Bildrath asked him to fetch. He is excitedly curious about the players' presence, but Bildrath orders him to return to his bedroom in order to avoid "disturbing the customers."

If Bildrath orders Parriwimple to remove the players from the store, Parriwimple attempts to grapple them and pull them out the door, preferring to avoid violence if at all possible.

## B5g. Mad Mary's Townhouse
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 3: Area E3.</em></span>

There should be no reason for the players to visit <span class="citation">Mad Mary's Townhouse (p. 44)</span> in this revision. However, if they do, the following changes have been made:

Mad Mary did not hide Gertruda in this house for her entire life. Instead, Gertruda lived a fairly ordinary life—albeit one with a fairly overbearing widowed mother. (Ireena and Gertruda initially bonded as young girls over the loss of their parents—Ireena's mother and Gertruda's father.) When he was alive, Gertruda's father was a merchant who raised Gertruda on stories of great lords and ladies, using their family's meager funds to purchase her occasional books from Vistani caravans regarding diplomacy and military history.

The first floor of this old, dirty dwelling comprises a one-room divided living space. To the north lies a small kitchen, its countertops dirty and covered with dust. There is a broken glass on the floor and a rotted meal for two set on a table covered with a dirty blue tablecloth. (Mary poured herself a glass of wine to steady her nerves after realizing Gertruda's disappearance, and dropped it on the floor in anguish.)

A small sitting area to the south contains a fireplace, two comfortable armchairs, and a dirty rug. Stairs lead up from here to the second floor.

The second floor corridor contains three wooden doors. One leads to a bathroom with an unemptied chamber pot and a bowl of dirty bathwater. Another leads to Mary's bedroom, which holds a writing desk and a bed. (If found here, Mary is sitting on the bed, quietly sobbing.) 

The third door, which is slightly ajar, leads to Gertruda's bedroom; a tray holding a broken tea kettle and cup has shattered on the floor before it. (Mary was bringing Gertruda tea when she found her daughter missing, and dropped it in horror.)

Gertruda's room holds a clumsily handwoven dress and a shelf holding a dozen well-read, dog-eared books, as well as a hairbrush, a rug, and an open window.

# Design Notes: Welcome to Barovia
***The Raven's Guidance.*** This scene has been added to foreshadow the Keepers of the Feather, to inform the players that ravens are helpful, to provide guidance and comfort to players who have recently entered a strange and alienating land, and to introduce the players to Muriel, a recurring member of the Keepers of the Feather who will accompany the players on multiple occasions in the future.

Morgantha has been relocated from the village of Barovia to the Barovian refugee camp outside of Vallaki to ensure that the players do not develop an antagonistic relationship with her too early and to make her more accessible in future arcs.

***The Blood of the Vine Tavern.*** The statue of Ismark the Great has been added to clearly set up Ismark's personal struggles to define himself apart from his ancestor, and to foreshadow the tale of Lugdana and the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind* that the players will hear at Tser Pool.

Arik has been made the sole owner of the tavern to create a sharper distinction between the Barovians and the Vistani. 

Ismark has been intentionally made a friendlier and more sympathetic character to encourage the players to build a warm and trusting relationship with him and his sister, Ireena. 

Mad Mary's plea has been relocated to the tavern and combined with Ismark's introduction to create a more dramatic and engaging opportunity for the players to learn about the village's plight.

Gertruda has been changed to be Doru's betrothed to provide her with a more rational reason to have willingly gone to the castle, and to add additional tragic irony to Doru's secret imprisonment in the undercroft of the church.

It is intentional that Ismark neither offers payment for Ireena's escort, nor requests it for allowing the players to stay at his home. By graciously offering the players a place to stay, free of charge, Ismark should easily earn goodwill from the players, thereby encouraging them to accept his request when he asks if Ireena can accompany them to Vallaki.

***The Burgomaster's Mansion.*** Ireena and Ismark's conversation has been added to make Ireena a more sympathetic character.

Ireena now knows that she was adopted and bears no ill will or melancholy regarding this fact. Her ignorance of her adoption in the original module serves no narrative purpose, and her devotion to Kolyan Indirovich is far more endearing if her love is undiminished by their adoptive relationship. Knowledge of her adoption also foreshadows her relationship to Izek Strazni later on, thereby ensuring that the reveal of their connection packs a greater dramatic punch.

Madam Eva's dream invitation has been added to provide the players with a clear, urgent, and meaningful reason to travel to Tser Pool before traveling to Vallaki. The players' vision of the March of the Dead from the burgomaster's mansion also establishes the danger of opposing Strahd, raising the tension for when the players first encounter him at the River Ivlis Crossroads.

This sequence intentionally foregoes a popular community modification involving an overnight siege of the mansion staged by Strahd's forces. Such a dangerous experience would make the players less comfortable with escorting Ireena to Vallaki, would establish Strahd as a savage and hostile antagonist, and would deny the players their first opportunity for rest and recovery since the campaign first began.

Ireena Kolyana is intentionally not offered as a potential player character—despite an occasional community interest in making her so—because providing the players with a Barovian player character diminishes the "fish-out-of-water" experience of exploring Barovia; because few players are willing or able to endure Strahd's abusive relationship with Ireena (along with Izek's stalking and kidnapping of her); because, for the first half of **Act II: The Shadowed Town**, the adventure relies upon Ireena's nature as a generally passive character whose path diverges from the party's; and because Ireena's particular arc throughout the campaign is likely to conflict with player expectations and preferences for their own character's arc.

***Bildrath's Mercantile.*** Bildrath has been changed to be slightly more reasonable and far more sympathetic, aiming to discourage players from attacking him and thereby alienating Ismark and Ireena.

***The Barovian Church.*** Parriwimple has been placed by the entrance to the church to inspire curiosity regarding Donavich's strange behavior and Doru's ultimate fate, and to further develop the tragedy endured by the residents of the village.

The plotline involving Donavich's holy symbol and Doru's blood trial has been added to provide the players with an opportunity to interact with Doru, to enhance the exposition with dramatic tension, and to teach the players that NPCs generally should be aided, not attacked. The players' conversation with Doru also sets up Gertruda's and Escher's presence in Castle Ravenloft and introduces Dr. Rudolph van Richten.

***The Burial.*** This guide intentionally foregoes two popular community additions to the burgomaster's burial: Rahadin's delivery of Strahd's condolences and Strahd's silent observation of the ceremony

Throughout this campaign, it is critical to remember that Strahd is not omniscient. In fact, the players' efforts to avoid and foil his spies serves as a recurrent source of tension and gameplay as they travel through Barovia. As such, from a practical matter, it is important to note that neither Strahd nor Rahadin would have any way of knowing that the burgomaster would be buried on this precise date and time.

More significantly, Strahd views Ireena with neither romance nor regret. He has no illusions that he might win her hand for his own, nor does he believe that such efforts might prove worth his while. A message expressing his condolences to his prey—or a silent vigil observing the burial—are sentiments that Strahd would never express.

Finally, this guide also foregoes a popular community modification that adds an attack by Strahd's wolves and undead during the ceremony. In addition to the fact that Strahd, unaware of the date and time of the burial, would have no opportunity to send it, such an overt attack would immediately antagonize the players and ensure that they feel actively unsafe around Strahd. It is a delicate balancing act to ensure that the players hate and fear Strahd while still feeling safe enough to accept his invitation to dine at Ravenloft. An outright assault on the players destroys that fragile balance utterly.
