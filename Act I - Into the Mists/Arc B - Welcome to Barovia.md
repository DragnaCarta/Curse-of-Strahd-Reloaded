*An adventure for five 3rd-level characters.*

> [!warning]+ **Recent Update**
> This arc was substantially revised on July 19, 2024. To access the deprecated version of this arc, visit [[Deprecated Material/Arc B - Welcome to Barovia|Arc B - Welcome to Barovia]] in the Deprecated Materials appendix.

In this arc, the players travel to the gloomy village of Barovia, which has been ravaged by death and despair in the wake of Strahd’s revival. When a disguised wereraven guides them to the Blood of the Vine Tavern, they meet Ismark, the eldest child of the village’s recently wounded burgomaster.

There, the players learn that the village has been under attack by Strahd’s undead horde each night for the past six nights—and that the horde is expected to return at dusk. In exchange for food, shelter, and information, Ismark asks the players to take up arms alongside the Barovians and prepare to defend the village’s fortifications against the onslaught of the dead.

After successfully defending the barricades, the players learn that Strahd has personally invaded the burgomaster’s mansion, killing Ismark’s father and biting his sister, Ireena. With the village’s burgomaster dead, Strahd formally withdraws the horde from the village, allowing Ismark, Ireena, and the players to pick up the pieces.

The following morning, Ismark asks the players to help bring their father’s remains to the local church for burial, escort Ireena to Vallaki, and ask the Vistani seer Madam Eva how Strahd can be defeated. Upon delivering the Burgomaster's coffin to the church the following dawn, the players can meet Doru, Father Donavich's son, who Strahd transformed into a vampire spawn as punishment for his rebellion. The players then face a choice: Will they destroy Doru, as Father Donavich requests—or spare him?

> [!design]+ **Design Note: Arrival in Barovia**
> The players’ arrival in the village of Barovia has been substantially reworked to create a strong inciting incident for the campaign, ensuring they have an immediate and concrete reason to seek out Madam Eva’s Tarokka reading, an opportunity to form relationships with the villagers of Barovia, and personalized stakes in seeing Strahd defeated.

<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 2: Area B.</em></span>

This scene unfolds as described in <span class="citation">Gates of Barovia (p. 34)</span>.

The journey from the Gates of Barovia to [[#B3. Svalich Woods]] is one-quarter mile long and takes five minutes.
# B3. Svalich Woods
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 2: Area C.</em></span>

This scene begins as described in <span class="citation">Svalich Woods (p. 34)</span>. However, when the players find the corpse of Dalvan Olensky, he is not holding a crumpled envelope, and his clothes appear to have been torn by brambles and thorns, rather than claw marks. He doesn't appear to have any visible wounds, but a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals that he died of exhaustion.

Instead of the envelope, Dalvan is now holding an old, tarnished copper compass. While it remains close to the edge of the Barovian valley, its needle trembles strangely even when held still.

Dalvan's hand holding the compass is splayed out in the direction of a nearby tree, which bears thirteen tally marks and an arrow that points deeper into the woods, along what seems to be a well-traveled footpath.

> [!lore]+ **What Happened to Dalvan?**
>
> In the wake of Strahd's attack on the village of Barovia, one of the survivors—a young man named Dalvan Olensky—was overcome with terror and despair.
>
> Determined to find a way free from Barovia, Dalvan traveled to the Vistani encampment at Tser Pool, seeking out the reputed Vistani seer Madam Eva. There, Madam Eva read his future in the Tarokka cards, and drew the Horseman—a card that predicted that he would die in the Barovian valley.
>
> Panicked, Dalvan returned to the village of Barovia under cover of night, stole a horse and compass, and set off for the eastern road out of Barovia. When the Svalich Road seemed to end, Dalvan delved into the woods, crossing through the mist and reemerging on the opposite side of the road.
>
> A terrified, desperate, and delirious Dalvan repeated the loop thirteen times, his stolen horse expiring from exhaustion halfway through. It wasn't long before Dalvan succumbed to the effects of the Barovian fog as well—though not before inscribing his own epitaph in the form of the carving on the fourth tree.
>
> Madam Eva regrets Dalvan's fate—but as the avatar of the Seeker, she is bound to read the future when asked, and knows that no efforts to escape can unravel a future that she has foreseen.

>[!info]+ **Dalvan's Compass**
>Like all compasses in Barovia, Dalvan's compass behaves strangely as it approaches the vicinity of the edge of the Barovian valley—such as by Yester Hill in [[Arc J - The Stolen Gem]] or toward the peak of Mount Ghakis in [[Arc T - The Amber Temple]]. Because there is no true "magnetic north" beyond the Mists that encircle Barovia, the needle of a compass that approaches the edge of the valley begins to tremble and eventually spin wildly the closer it gets. (This strange behavior ends when the compass is removed from the edge of the valley.)

If the players follow the footpath in the direction of the arrow, they soon come to a second tree, which bears another thirteen tally marks and an arrow that points further along the direction of the footpath. The edge of the footpath here bears the corpse of a **horse**, which is in a similar state of decay to Dalvan's.

If the players continue to follow the footpath in the direction of the arrows, they come to a third tree, which bears another thirteen tally marks and an arrow that points further along the direction of the footpath, which visibly vanishes into a wall of impenetrable fog.

The fog is part of the Mists that surround and entrap Barovia. If the players brought Dalvan's compass with them, the needle is now spinning wildly in circles.

If the players follow the footpath through the fog, they emerge after 2d4 minutes in an unfamiliar portion of the Svalich Woods. Each time the players emerge from the wall of fog around Barovia, they must make a DC 5 Constitution saving throw or take 1 level of exhaustion, as the fog saps their energy and drains their life force. (The DC increases by 5 each time that the players pass through the fog again.)

Upon emerging from the fog, the players can see a fourth tree, which bears another thirteen tally marks and an arrow that points further along the direction of the footpath. In addition, the fourth tree appears to bear a carving and has an object protruding from its trunk. If the players inspect it, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Someone has stabbed an old dagger in the trunk of this old, gnarled tree. Beside it lies a rough carving of a figure atop a horse, just above two sets of rough-hewn words: </p>
<p>"THE HORSEMAN RIDES." </p>
<p>"THE SEER SPOKE TRUE."</p>
</div>

If the players follow the footpath in the direction of the arrow, they find that it crosses the Svalich Road before returning to the location of Dalvan's corpse. 

If the players then leave Dalvan's corpse and return, they find that both his and the horse's remains have vanished.

> [!design]+ **Design Note: Dalvan’s Fate**
> Dalvan’s task in the original module—placing a warning note at the eastern Barovian gates—makes little sense, given that Burgomaster Indirovich would know that those who arrive in Barovia from beyond the Mists can’t turn back, even before they enter the Barovian gates. Instead, Dalvan’s role has been revised to foreshadow Madam Eva’s prophetic insight and communicate the perils (and mechanics) of entering the Mists. 
>
> Dalvan and his horse will later reappear as the skeletal rider described in <span class="citation">Skeletal Rider (p. 31)</span> in [[Act I - Into the Mists/Arc C - Into the Valley#C5. The Skeletal Rider|Arc C - Into the Valley]]. The rider will again appear in [[Arc O - Dinner with the Devil#O3b. The Rider’s Guidance|Arc O - Dinner with the Devil]], guiding the players at Madam Eva’s direction to Katarina’s tree and long-lost locket, which the players can use to let Varushka’s spirit find peace in [[Arc O - Dinner with the Devil#Varushka’s Grief|Arc O - Dinner with the Devil]].
# B4. Barovian Overlook
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 2: Area D.</em></span>

The players emerge from the Svalich Woods one mile and twenty minutes after departing Dalvan's corpse. When they do, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The dark woods fall away, revealing a misted, gloomy valley dotted with thick clouds of fog. </p>
<p>Rolling thunderclouds cast a gray pall over the land below, no sun visible in the cold, grey light. Evergreen trees climb the sides of the mountains that enclose the valley. To the north rises a stony mount with tufts of trees; to the south, a snow-capped peak with rugged slopes towers imperiously above the land below.</p>
<p>The muddy road continues on ahead, passing through yellowed grasses and farmland until it reaches a small, humble settlement hunkered down in the earth. Alongside the road, a river flows as clear as a blue winter sky through the valley. </p>
<p>Far above the village looms a dark, twisted castle, standing alone atop a pillar of sheer stone. For an instant, a distant spear of lightning crackles, illuminating the towering keep in harsh lights and shadows—and then a thick bank of fog rolls in, concealing the village and castle from view.</p>
</div>

The journey from here to the outskirts of the village is two miles long and takes forty minutes.
# B5. The Village of Barovia

> [!info]+ **The Fortified Village**
> The village of Barovia has been heavily fortified to defend against Strahd’s nightly siege. Barricades composed of logs, planks, and broken furniture have been erected at every major entrance into the settlement, with additional obstructions raised in every alleyway or gap between the villagers’ homes. A trench has been dug around the village and planted with sharp stakes, and archers patrol the rooftops at all hours of day and night.
## B5a. The Barricade
This scene largely unfolds as described in <span class="citation">Approaching the Village (p. 41)</span>. However, modify the description as follows:

<div class="description">
<p>As the morning deepens, the overcast skies brightening to a dull, gloomy grey, the outskirts of the village come into clearer view. A wide dirt trench surrounds the settlement, five feet across and just as deep, with hundreds of sharpened wooden stakes thrusting up like jagged teeth from the earth within. Up ahead, beside a tall heap of charred wood, the road continues over a makeshift wooden bridge, the muddy ground beyond giving way to slick, wet cobblestones.</p>
<p>Wooden barricades stand haphazardly along the streets. The structures around them bear scorch marks and gashes, and several buildings show partially collapsed roofs or walls, allowing the cold, creeping fog to drift silently inside.</p>
<p>The tall shapes of village dwellings stand above the rest, looming out of the dense fog that clings to the earth. Figures bearing crossbows patrol the old rooftops above, while a half-dozen haunted-looking villagers make repairs to a thirty-foot barricade blocking the main street. A tall, broad-shouldered man with shoulder-length blond hair and a chiseled jaw leads the work, wearing an old longsword buckled to his hip and a set of splint armor over a collared coat. A raven with blue-tipped wings perches atop one of the rooftops nearby, watching the proceedings below with obvious interest.</p>
</div>

![[Ismark.png]]
<span class="credit">"Ismark Kolyanovich" by Caleb Cleveland. Support him on <a href="https://patreon.com/calebisdrawing/">Patreon!</a></span>
The man is Ismark Kolyanovich, who is largely as described in <span class="citation">E2. Blood of the Vine Tavern (p. 43)</span>. The raven is Muriel, a disguised **wereraven** and member of the [[Lore of Barovia#Factions#Keepers of the Feather|Keepers of the Feather]]. Two **scouts** bearing light crossbows (+4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target, *Hit:* 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage) and named Kereza and Korga stand watch on the rooftops nearby, while six Barovian **commoners** make repairs to the barricade.

> [!profile]+ **Profile: Ismark Kolyanovich**
>
> **Roleplaying Information**
> ***Resonance.*** Ismark should inspire flattery with his genuine interest and empathy for the players, sympathy for his guilt and desperation, endearment for his anxiety to step beyond his ancestor's shadow, and gratitude for his friendliness and aid.
>
> ***Emotions.*** Ismark most often feels concerned, guilty, friendly, melancholy, defiant, hopeful, desperate, and grateful.
>
> ***Motivations.*** Ismark wants to keep his village and Ireena safe, keep his father's memory alive, and one day match his ancestor's legacy.
>
> ***Inspirations.*** When playing Ismark, channel Jon Snow (*Game of Thrones*), Faramir (*Lord of the Rings*), and Trevor Belmont (*Castlevania*).
>
> **Character Information**
> ***Persona.*** To the world, Ismark is a courageous, reliable, and compassionate leader. To those he trusts, Ismark is a self-doubting, struggling warrior desperate to keep his loved ones safe. Deep down, Ismark worries that he will never live up to his ancestor's deeds—and fears that he has already irreparably failed.
>
> ***Morale.*** In a fight, Ismark would first seek to mediate the parties' conflict, but would gladly draw his sword—and even fight to the death—if he believed that he was fighting for something or someone worth protecting.
>
> ***Relationships.*** Ismark is the adoptive brother of Ireena Kolyana, and the great-grandson of Ismark the Great.

As the players approach, Kereza challenges them. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A woman on the rooftops calls down to you: “Halt! Declare yourselves—be you dead or alive?" Her compatriot, a grim-looking man clad in leather armor, twitches toward the crossbow at his hip.</p>
</div>

Kereza is suspicious of the players, believing them to be vampires, zombies, or ghouls in disguise. Regardless of the players’ response, Ismark intervenes, gently chiding Kereza for her paranoia and reassuring the other Barovians with good humor that the players are clearly alive, “just like us." 

Ismark then kindly invites the players beyond the barricade and welcomes them. He confesses, however, that he’s afraid they’ve come at a poor time, sharing that the village has been under siege by an undead horde the past several nights. 

After confirming that the barricade is nearly repaired, Ismark invites the players to join him at the Blood of the Vine Tavern at the center of town, where he has further business to attend to, and where they can speak further and share drinks. (“We have at least three hours before dusk falls," he says, squinting at the gray sky overhead. “Should give us enough time before the dead return.")

If the players agree, Muriel follows them to the town square, staying aloft in the air overhead and watching with keen interest.

> [!abstract]+ **The Raven**
> Ismark doesn’t know that the blue-winged raven is a wereraven, and doesn’t know whether anyone has given it a name. He believes the raven’s presence is a good omen, however, and can share the superstition about ravens described in <span class="citation">Beliefs and Superstitutions (p. 28)</span>. (This superstition is shared by all Barovians, not just Vistani.)

> [!design]+ **Design Note: Entering the Village**
> This scene has been written to immediately convey the villagers’ wariness, establish Ismark as a sympathetic ally, and introduce the **wereraven** Muriel Vinshaw and the ravens of Barovia, thereby foreshadowing the Keepers of the Feather. 
>
> Muriel will later reappear in [[Act I - Into the Mists/Arc C - Into the Valley#C3. The Strix|Arc C - Into the Valley]], fleeing a **greater strix** after eavesdropping on Strahd’s meeting with Madam Eva, and will accompany the players to the town of Vallaki throughout the remainder of Arc C. Muriel will also appear in her human form and persona in [[Arc J - The Stolen Gem#Meeting Muriel|Arc J - The Stolen Gem]] to accompany the players as they journey to the Wizard of Wines winery, and will reveal her true lycanthropic nature at [[Act I - Into the Mists/Arc C - Into the Valley#Ludmilla’s Provocations|Yester Hill]].
## B5b. The Town Square
As the players and Ismark pass through the village streets, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Haggard villagers with haunted eyes watch as you pass, their clothes stained dark with mud or blood and their hands never far from a bow, axe, or pitchfork. Ismark greets each one by name. Several approach him, speaking quietly in hushed tones before fleeing once more into the groaning homes or gloomy alleyways around you.</p>
<p>Ismark guides you through a second, larger barricade, manned by grim-faced villagers wielding clubs and spears. Beyond it stands an old, chipped stone statue standing at the center of a small town square, depicting a man wearing leather armor and holding a sword. More than a dozen makeshift tents and campfires have been set up around it, hosting a haggard-looking host of young, old, and sickly-looking villagers.</p>
</div>

Add the description of the exterior of the Blood of the Vine Tavern, given in <span class="citation">E2. Blood of the Vine Tavern (p. 43)</span>.

The tents host the village’s elderly, sick, and children, who have been gathered here as a fortification of last resort. The statue bears a weather-worn plaque at its base, which reads: “ISMARK ANTONOVICH THE GREAT. Burgomaster of Barovia. Bane of Vampires. 618—662 B.C." (“B.C." stands for “Barovian Calendar.") 
![[Ismark the Great.png]]
<span class="credit">"Ismark the Great" by Caleb Cleveland. Support him on <a href="https://patreon.com/calebisdrawing/">Patreon!</a></span>
If the players ask about the statue, Ismark can share the following information:
 
* In life, Ismark Antonovich, also known as Ismark the Great, was a mighty warrior and the burgomaster of the village of Barovia. In his prime, he fought scores of vampires and other undead left behind when Strahd vanished from public view. He eventually died defending a group of trappers from a dire wolf attack at the age of 44, and the statue outside was erected in his honor. 
* Ismark Antonovich was Ismark Kolyanovich's great-grandfather. Ismark's father, Kolyan, gave him that name in the hopes that he would one day become a great warrior.
## B5c. The Blood of the Vine Tavern
This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">E2. Blood of the Vine Tavern (p. 43)</span>. However, instead of Alenka, Mirabel, and Sorvia—the three Vistani found here in the original module—Arik is the sole owner and proprietor of the tavern. (Alenka, Mirabel, and Sorvia aren’t present in the tavern, having fled the village for Tser Pool the day before the siege began.)

After entering the tavern, Ismark pays Arik to fetch them drinks. As the players sit down with him, Ismark apologizes for the state of the village and asks how they’ve come to arrive in the valley. "You must have a thousand questions," he says sympathetically. "I'd be glad to answer as many as I can."

Ismark can share the following information:

* The players have entered the land of Barovia, a realm surrounded by deadly fog and ruled by Strahd von Zarovich, a powerful vampire who slumbered in Castle Ravenloft until recently.
* Outsiders are occasionally spirited into Barovia by the mists. (Ismark has no knowledge of Death House, but vaguely remembers tales of unorthodox ways by which travelers have come to the valley.) There is no escaping Barovia once an outsider has entered it.
* Just over three months ago, a man named Doru, the son of the village priest, raised a rebellion against the castle, hoping to free the valley from its prison in the mists. Their revolt failed, awakening Strahd from his dormancy and spurring the vampire to vow vengeance upon the village below.
* Several dozen Barovians fled to the town of Vallaki, almost a day’s travel to the west. The remainder stayed in the village, determined to defend their homes and those who were unable to make the journey.
* Six nights ago, Strahd’s undead forces began attacking the town. Each night, the Barovians beat back multiple waves of the dead—and each night, the horde comes ever-closer to breaching the village’s defenses.
* Many Barovians fear that the village is doomed. However, the undead have infested the woods to the north, west, and south, blocking the Old Svalich Road just past the Ivlis River. With the Mists blocking passage to the east, the village has been effectively cut off from the world, left to survive on its own—or perish.

[[Non-Player Characters#Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] can also share the village’s recent history, as well as most of the information in <span class="citation">Roleplaying Ismark (p. 43)</span> and <span class="citation">Barovian Lore (p. 26)</span>. However, Ismark doesn't mention a "mad wizard" and he doesn't suggest that the Vistani serve Strahd. (Note that Ismark’s father, Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich, is still alive—albeit wounded—in the burgomaster’s mansion, and Ismark’s sister, Ireena Kolyana, hasn’t yet been bitten by Strahd.)
### Bildrath's Fury
Shortly after Ismark begins answering the players' questions, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Something slams against a nearby table—and the sound draws your attention to a man sitting not far away, his clenched fist twitching against his table's wooden surface. He is squat, with greasy receding salt-and-pepper hair and a patched, well-worn coat. A scowl mars his face as he turns his dark eyes toward your group. "It's a fool's errand to put your faith in Ismark the <em>Lesser</em>," he rasps, eyes lingering upon each of you. "Best to seek better company, lest you wind up in the ground with the last fools that trusted him."</p>
</div>

The man is Bildrath Cantemir, the owner of <span class="citation">Bildrath's Mercantile (p. 43)</span>. If any of the players appear interested in speaking with him further, he invites them to sit at his table instead to "hear the real story of this bloody land." "The wine's shit," he grunts, shoving a pitcher of wine across the table, "but so's everything else."

If asked about Bildrath's statement about "the last fools that trusted him," Ismark winces. "He's right to hate me," he says quietly. "I asked the other villagers to stay and defend our homes. I was arrogant and foolish—I didn't appreciate just how powerful the Devil and his creatures were." He closes his eyes. "Now dozens of my friends and neighbors are gone—and I'm still here."

Should one or more of the players join him, Bildrath can share the following information:

* Just over three months ago, a pack of would-be "revolutionaries" marched off to Castle Ravenloft to "slay the vampire." Doru, the son of Father Donavich, the village priest, "filled their heads with fairy tales" of banishing the Mists and bringing the Sun back to Barovia.
* None of the revolutionaries ever came back. A few days later, a dusk-skinned elf came to the village and announced that the village had ninety days to make peace with the gods before the lord of Castle Ravenloft—now awoken after a hundred years of slumber—exacted penance for their disobedience.
* Some villagers left. Many others wanted to leave. However, Ismark delivered a resounding speech in the village square before the statue of Ismark the Great, promising the villagers that those who remained would stand and defend their homes. "The audacity of the bastard," Bildrath sneers. "Standing in front of his great-grandfather's statue like he was worth a *tenth* of him."
* Bildrath wanted to leave—but his sister, Marta, and her husband, Dragomir, chose to stay with their son, Parriwimple, inspired by Ismark's words. Unwilling to leave his family, Bildrath stayed as well. "They figured they'd fight to defend what's theirs," he chokes out, blinking back tears. "Bloody *idiots* should've run, and never looked back."
* Ninety days after the elf delivered his proclamation, the undead came, swarming in hordes dozens strong from the Svalich Wood. The villagers fought back, defending the streets with barricades, swords, and arrows. "But the dead kept coming," Bildrath croaks. "And Marta—" He falls silent. (Bildrath lost Marta and Dragomir in the attacks, and blames Ismark for his failure to protect them.)

When he's regained his composure, Bildrath warns the players that the village is doomed, and likely all of Barovia with it. "There's no sun to bring back," he spits. "No escape from the mists. This is Hell, now and for all eternity. The sooner you lot accept that, the better off you'll be."
### Mary's News
As the players' conversations with [[Non-Player Characters#Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and Bildrath wind to a close, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The door to the tavern swings open once more, and a woman steps through, clad in a tattered and threadbare cloak. Her hair, tied into two loops that fall around her neck, is unkempt and tangled, and her wide eyes dart across the room with fearful energy.</p>
<p>Her gaze falls upon Ismark, and she steps shakily forward. As her features come into the light, you see that her face is pale, her eyes blotchy, with dried tears staining the flesh across her cheeks. Her voice is a ragged, haunting whisper as she says, "Master Kolyanovich—I apologize for interrupting you and your guests. But I haven't seen Gertruda since last night, and Nori isn't in the stable. I think Gertruda's gone to the castle—alone."</p>
</div>

The tavern immediately falls silent, and Ismark's eyes crease with worry. He gives Mary his condolences, and promises that he will organize a search party to look for her. "If she didn’t make it to the castle, we'll find her—and bring her home safely."

> [!abstract]+ **The Search Party**
> If the players offer to assist the search party in locating Gertruda, Ismark thanks them for their generosity, but assures them that the hunters and trappers he plans to organize know the local roads and woods far better than they, and should be able to skirt alongside the edges of the undead horde without risking much trouble. "The more who accompany them, however," he says apologetically, "the more likely the horde notices their movements and attacks."
> 
> "If you'd like to help, however," he adds, "we can use all hands to organize tonight's defense here." Ismark then makes the request given in [[#Ismark’s Request]].

As he does, Bildrath snarls and spits, "More empty promises, Kolyanovich?" He turns to the players, glowering. "Have you lot ever seen something so cruel?"

After the players have had a chance to speak, Bildrath insists, "No one can survive alone on those roads. The girl's gone, Mary. I'm sorry." Mary then bursts into tears.

Unless the players intervene, the following sequence then unfolds:

* Ismark stands up, pushing his seat away from the table. "That's enough, Master Cantemir," he growls.
* "You going to put me in my place, Master Kolyanovich?" Bildrath sneers. "Stop lying to the woman. The girl's as good as dead. We'll all be joining her soon enough."
* "There's always a chance," Ismark says heatedly. He swallows, and glances back at Mary, then at the players. "You might have given up on our people, Bildrath, but I haven't."
* Bildrath eyes Ismark, his hands curling into fists. After a long, lingering moment, he spits on the floor and exits the tavern without addressing Ismark or the players. The taproom remains deathly quiet, the silence broken only by Mary's choking sobs.

If the players ask, Mary can share the following information:

* Gertruda is her twenty-one-year-old daughter. Ever since Doru, her betrothed, marched on Castle Ravenloft and failed to return, Gertruda has become fixated on the castle, believing that, if she could only journey to Castle Ravenloft and speak with the Devil, she could convince him to set Doru free from whatever prison he's been thrown in.
* Mary has repeatedly forbidden Gertruda from traveling to the castle. With the advent of the siege, however, Gertruda has become stubbornly convinced that a diplomatic solution is the only way to end the village's suffering.
* Last night, Mary and Gertruda had a tumultuous argument that ended with both on poor terms. This morning, Mary woke to find their old horse, Nori, missing from her stall—and Gertruda nowhere to be found. (Mary believes Gertruda took Nori in an effort to outrun the zombie horde.)

A few moments after Bildrath has left, if the players haven't already done so, Ismark turns to comfort Mary. "I promise you," he says, his voice breaking, "That I will do *everything* I can to see that Gertruda is brought home safely."

Once calmed, Mary wipes her eyes, thanks Ismark (and the players, if they comforted her), and departs the tavern.

> [!lore]+ **Where's Gertruda?**
> Gertruda, despairing at the state of the village and determined to show the same courage as Doru, left Barovia for Castle Ravenloft the morning of the players' arrival, seeking to plead for Strahd’s mercy. When she arrived at the castle, a trembling Gertruda demanded Strahd make good on his obligations as Barovia's liege-lord, providing for the safety and repairs the village so desperately needed. Impressed by her audacity, Strahd invited her to Castle Ravenloft to discuss the matter further—and she has remained there ever since.
### Ismark’s Request
After Mary departs, Ismark asks them to aid in defending the village’s eastern barricade that night. “Like it or not, we’re all in this together," he says somberly. “The more hands, the better. I don’t know if I can promise coin, but I can promise it’ll help all of us survive the night—yourselves included." In exchange for the players’ aid, Ismark is glad to offer them room and board at his family’s home. (The Blood of the Vine Tavern doesn't have rooms for rent.) 

If the players agree to aid in the town’s defense, Ismark is deeply grateful. He asks them to first retrieve a crate of “fire bottles" from his sister, Ireena, who is overseeing the defense of the village’s southern perimeter from their home, <span class="citation">E4. Burgomaster’s Mansion (p. 44)</span>. (Ismark, who has to return to the western barricades to prepare for the return of the dead, can’t take the time to do so himself.) If asked, Ismark can explain that a “fire bottle" is a bottle of distilled wine topped with a rag wick, meant to be lit and hurled at approaching undead.

Once the players have retrieved the crate of fire bottles and had an opportunity to rest at the manor, Ismark tells them, they should take the fire bottles to the eastern barricade—the place where they first entered the village—where they’ll be stationed throughout the night.
## B5d. The Burgomaster’s Mansion
This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">Burgomaster’s Mansion (p. 44)</span>. However, Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich has not yet been killed, and Ireena hasn’t yet been bitten.
### The Angry Mob
When the players arrive, they find a mob of ten Barovian **commoners** has formed outside of the mansion. Add the following to the end of this area’s description:

<div class="description">
<p>A small mob of villagers have gathered outside of the manor, brandishing pitchforks, brooms, and axes. A plain, tired-looking woman stands at their front, her wavy brown hair tied back with a wrinkled white bandana.</p>
<p>"Give her up, Kolyan!" she calls out. “Your defenses have held the Devil at bay, but they haven’t ended his scourge. It’s time to take matters into our own hands."</p>
<p>An older man dressed in fine clothes, his thinning gray hair receding across his scalp, leans heavily on a cane in the door. Heavy, bloodstained bandages wrap around his stomach, forehead, and left knee. Beside him stands a young woman with long, red hair and a steel breastplate over a long-sleeved gray tunic, her face ashen and tense. A rapier hangs in a sheath at her side, her right hand hovering over its glinting hilt.</p>
<p>“Go home, Alenka," the man booms. “The rest of you as well. For as long as I am burgomaster, I will not permit this madness." 
</div>

The brown-haired woman is Alenka Konstantinova, a middle-aged Barovian **commoner**. The older man is Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich, a **veteran** with four levels of exhaustion. The red-haired young woman is Ireena Kolyana, who is largely as described in <span class="citation">Roleplaying Ireena (p. 45)</span>.

> [!lore]+ **Alenka’s Grief**
> Alenka is the sister of Anton Konstantinovich, a Barovian man married to Dezdrelda Konstaninova. Two nights ago, Anton and Dezdrelda mysteriously vanished in the middle of the night during the siege; their bodies were never found. Their loss has driven Alenka to grief and paranoia, and given her a desperate need to seek an end to the siege by any means possible.
>
> Unbeknownst to Alenka, Anton and Dezdrelda are prisoners of Volenta Popofsky, one of Strahd’s vampiric brides, in Castle Ravenloft. The players will later encounter Anton as a masked servant in [[Arc O - Dinner with the Devil#Volenta’s Toy|Arc O - Dinner with the Devil]].

Driven to desperation by Strahd’s attacks on the village, Alenka and the mob believe that a sacrifice or offering is needed to appease the vampire and soothe his rage. The following conversation unfolds if the players don’t intervene:

* Alenka stonily informs Kolyan that a sacrifice to the vampire isn’t madness, but “common sense." “Legends say the Devil Strahd enjoys preying upon red-haired women," she tells him. “If her blood might win his favor, how can we do otherwise?"
* Kolyan replies that Alenka is a “fool" if she believes surrendering Ireena—or anyone else—will appease the Devil of Castle Ravenloft. “You are grasping for answers in a world that has none to offer," he thunders. “And we are Barovians. We do not turn on our own."
* Alenka retorts that Ireena isn’t a true Barovian—after all, Kolyan found her wandering the woods near the Pillarstone of Ravenloft as a child. (Ireena and Kolyan are already aware of this, and show no surprise at this statement.) “She’s not one of us," Alenka says sharply, “and if you’re going to choose her over us, neither are you." 
* Two of Alenka’s compatriots step closer to the mansion, brandishing their weapons. Kolyan gasps, “How dare you," steps forward, and nearly crumples from his wounds. Ireena catches him before he falls and commands the mob not to “lay a finger on her father." 

If the players are still present and haven’t yet intervened, Ireena pleads for their help as Alenka’s mob advances.

If the players intervene, Alenka, Kolyan, and Ireena receive them with unfamiliarity and surprise, though Alenka is suspicious that they may be spies for “the Devil Strahd." (If Ismark’s name is mentioned, Ireena and Kolyan are reassured, though Alenka spits on the ground and quietly cursed “Ismark the Lesser" under her breath.)

The players can disperse the mob by making a reasonable argument and succeeding on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, made with advantage if the players inquire into Alenka’s missing family members and show her sympathy. The players can also disperse the mob by brandishing their weapons or magic and succeeding on a DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check, made with advantage if they mention their recent battles in Death House.

If the players appear ready to attack the mob unprovoked, Kolyan pleads for them to avoid violence. “They’re confused," he says hoarsely, “but they’re Barovians, all the same."

If the players fail to disperse the mob but refuse to allow Ireena to be taken, Alenka commands them to stand down. If they refuse, she directs the mob to knock them unconscious before taking Ireena.

If combat breaks out, Ireena joins the players in defending the mansion while Kolyan pleads for the combatants to avoid killing anyone. If two of the Barovians are knocked unconscious, or if one is killed, the remainder flee.

> [!info]+ **Nonlethal Damage**
> Wanton death to the Barovian commoners will alienate the villagers and the members of Ismark’s family. Players who wish to avoid killing the Barovians can incapacitate their opponents as described in <span class="citation">Knocking a Creature Out (p. 198)</span>. If players choose not to do so, allow unconscious members of the mob to make death saving throws as described in <span class="citation">Monsters and Death (p. 198)</span>. 

If the players successfully disperse the mob, Kolyan and Ireena invite them into the manor with gratitude.

> [!design]- **Design Note: The Mob**
> This scene has been added to communicate Ireena’s origins to the players, foreshadow Strahd’s interest in her, offer a dramatic question while the players visit the mansion, and endear Ireena and Kolyan to the players before Strahd’s arrival during the siege later that night.
### Within the Mansion
This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">E4. Burgomaster’s Mansion (p. 44)</span>. However, remove the last sentence in this area’s description (referring to Kolyan’s corpse).

If the players assisted in dispersing the mob, Kolyan and Ireena welcome them warmly, especially if the players mention Ismark’s name. Whether or not the players mention that Ismark granted them room and board at the manor, Kolyan invites them to stay for lunch in gratitude for their aid in dealing with Alenka.
#### Lunch with the Burgomaster
Lunch, which is already stewing in a pot over the kitchen hearth, is a stew of turnips and rabbit meat. Ireena apologizes for the sparse meal, but the players can clearly see that the family’s pantry is nearly bare.

During the meal, Kolyan and Ireena ask the players about their interests and lives outside of Barovia. Ireena especially is fascinated by tales of the world beyond the mists. 

If the players are looking to purchase additional supplies, Ireena offers them directions to Bildrath’s Mercantile, but warns them not to mention Ismark's name. If the players ask her why Ismark is called "the Lesser," Ireena and Kolyan wince, and can share the following information:

* When Strahd's dusk elf servant—a cruel-looking man named Rahadin—delivered his warning three months ago, many Barovians were prepared to flee the village for Vallaki.
* Ismark, however, delivered a thundering and inspiring speech, invoking the memory of Lugdana and Ismark the Great to encourage them to stay and fight for their homes. Most did so.
* When Strahd's siege began, many who lost homes or loved ones blamed Ismark, who they felt had led them astray with his foolish fantasies of heroism and valor. They now call him "Ismark the Lesser" in mockery of his ancestry.
* No one feels more guilty or ashamed than Ismark himself, who has taken the weight of every death incurred in the siege on his own shoulders.

If the players ask about Doru's rebellion, Ireena can share the following information:

* Doru was a friend of theirs, and the son of the village priest Father Donavich. He was a bright and cheery young man, with a sunny disposition and a zeal for everything he did.
* Just over three months ago, without warning, Doru announced a crusade against Castle Ravenloft, which he proclaimed would free Barovia from the mists and return sunlight to the valley. Over two dozen young Barovians accompanied him, as well as a scholar from distant lands named Alanik Ray, who had been staying as a guest at Ismark and Ireena's home for the previous several weeks while studying Barovian history and ecology. 
* Ireena doesn't recall much about Alanik, other than that he was a curious, somewhat intense man who kept to himself, took long walks into the Svalich Woods, and owned a pet monkey. She does remember, however, that he had a furious argument with Doru at one point, which confused her when he accompanied Doru to Castle Ravenloft shortly thereafter.
#### Kolyan’s Dilemma
During lunch, Kolyan invites the players to help him deliberate on a dilemma he’s been trying to solve, noting that he would find it useful to have “an outside perspective" on the matter. If the players agree to do so, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The burgomaster nods toward a sheet of parchment lying across a writing desk. On its surface, you can make out a crude drawing of the area around the village, with thin lines depicting the Old Svalich Road and the Ivlis River to the southwest, and darker shapes depicting the Svalich Wood to the north, west, and south.</p>
<p>"Each night," he rumbles, “dozens of undead lay siege to our defenses, killing some and wounding many more. Instead of attacking all at once, however, they arrive in groups, with each wave striking our defenses separately, and almost randomly throughout the night. What do you make of that?"</p>
</div>

After the players have discussed and answered Kolyan’s question, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Kolyan nods. “Interesting. One more thing: Although dozens of the dead attack the village each night, our scouts have reported that hundreds more lurk in the woods around us—perhaps as many as a thousand. If they attacked all at once, we would surely be overrun—and yet, seemingly by the grace of the Morninglord, they have not. Why?</p>
</div>

If the players provide a suitably impressive or insightful answer, Kolyan asks if they intend to travel to the other settlements beyond Barovia if they survive the night—namely, Vallaki and Krezk to the west. If the players express an interest in doing so, Kolyan fetches a quill and ink from his writing desk and offers to draft them a signed letter of introduction. When completed, the letter reads as follows:

<div class="description">
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>I humbly ask that you provide the bearer of this letter with what aid you can. Trust in their purpose, assist in their endeavors, and offer shelter and counsel if you are able. Please extend to them every courtesy you would afford a friend of mine.</p>
<p>With utmost respect,</p>
<p>Kolyan Indirovich<br>
Burgomaster of Barovia</p>
</div>

The letter is sealed with the wax sigil of the burgomaster of Barovia: a longsword before a rising sun. Kolyan concedes that he cannot promise the letter will be obeyed, noting it has been “years" since he traveled to any of the other settlements in the valley. He vows, however, that it should at least “open the ears" of those they may wish to approach, such as Baron Vargas Vallakovich and Lady Fiona Wachter of Vallaki, or Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov of Krezk.

> [!item]+ **Letter of Introduction**
> Players who present Kolyan’s letter of introduction to Baron Vargas Vallakovich, Lady Fiona Wachter of Vallaki, Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov of Krezk within the first ten minutes of meeting them, or their servants or family members, have advantage on any Charisma (Persuasion) check made within that ten minutes, provided it is possible for the check to succeed.
#### Rooms at the Mansion
If the players mention Ismark's offer to provide them with rooms, Ireena shows them to the mansion’s two guest bedrooms and provides them with basic supplies. "I can't say how much sleep you'll be able to get, or when," she says apologetically, her own eyes bearing dark circles beneath them. "But if nothing else, they should provide a quiet place to rest."

If the players ask about her parents, Ireena freely shares the following information while asking after the players' own families:

* Ismark and Ireena's mother was Korina Targolova. Korina died of a sickness fourteen years ago, but Kolyan has done his best since then to continue raising both children alone. (The scarf Ireena wears is her last memory of her mother.)
* Kolyan, their father, was the one who found Ireena when she was a young girl, by the edge of the Svalich Woods near the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. Ireena doesn't remember anything of her past before then, but is grateful to her parents for taking her in and loving her dearly.

As the players explore their rooms, one of them finds a torn excerpt of *Van Richten's Guide to Vampires* by Dr. Rudolph van Richten sitting on a night table by the bed. This excerpt of the preface, which Van Richten tore from Doru's book in the midst of a furious argument, reads as follows:

<div class="description">
<p>In some shadowed corners of the world, the vampire reigns as a fearsome predator. Beyond mere bloodlust, these creatures are cursed with a range of abilities and weaknesses that make them as enigmatic as they are terrifying.</p>
<p>Their bodies are resilient to mundane weapons, shrugging off blows that would fell most mortals and regenerating even grievous wounds in a matter of moments. They move with unnatural grace, their senses sharply attuned to the whispers of the night. But it is in their supernatural abilities that their true horror lies. They can bend the will of others to their own, ensnaring friend and foe with but a gaze and a whisper. They can shift form with the ease of thought, becoming bats, wolves, or even a sinister mist that creeps beneath doorways and through cracks. And those their fangs kill become vampire spawn—ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood.</p>
<p>These creatures are not wholly invincible, however, possessing a tapestry of strengths woven with fatal weaknesses. Sunlight and running water can end their cursed existence, and wooden stakes through the heart will paralyze them as they sleep. They recoil from the sight of certain holy symbols, and cannot enter a residence without an invitation. They bear neither shadow nor reflection, and must return to their coffins, crypts, or graves to rest by day.</p>
<p>It is said that the bloodlust of these creatures is an unquenchable fire that burns within their undead hearts. The young and newly turned are slaves to this craving, often losing themselves in a frenzy at the mere scent of blood. But those who have walked the night for centuries, as well as those with indomitable focus and will, may learn to temper this fire. Those who do so possess the rare ability to conceal their monstrous nature, retracting and exposing their fangs at will—a sign that the monster within is held at bay, if only while the vampire allows.</p>
<p>To create a new vampire, a vampire must fully drain the blood of its victim without killing it—a torturous and careful process that can often take multiple nights. For some vampires, this process is a practical means of creating fresh and powerful thralls; for others, it presents a sadistic opportunity to slowly break their victim's will. Some vampires in the latter camp may even appear as an intermittent predator in the night, haunting their target over days or weeks before finally ending their suffering.</p>
</div>

Kolyan and Ireena don't recognize the excerpt, but Ireena recalls that Doru owned a copy of *Van Richten's Guide to Vampires*, which he loved. Neither is sure how this excerpt came to be in their guest room.

When the players are ready to depart, Ireena retrieves a wooden crate containing twelve *fire bottles* (see below) from a closet, with each bottle packed securely between wads of straw.

> [!item]+ **Fire Bottle**
> This bottle of Purple Grapemash No. 3, which bears the stamp of the Wizard of Wines winery, has been distilled, increasing its alcohol content, and had its cork removed and replaced with a rag wick. 
> 
> As an action, a creature can use a lit torch or other fire source to light the wick, then throw the bottle up to 20 feet, shattering on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the bottle as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. 
> 
> A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

> [!abstract]+ **Visiting the Church**
> Players who insist upon visiting <span class="citation">E5. Church (p. 45)</span> find it largely as described in [[#B5i. The Barovian Church]] below. However, Parriwimple is not at the church at this time, and Father Donavich does not mention Doru's fate without Ireena or Ismark present.
## B5e. Bildrath’s Mercantile
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 3: Area E1.</em></span>

Should the players choose to visit it before proceeding to [[#B5f. The Eastern Barricade]], this  area is largely as described in <span class="citation">Bildrath’s Mercantile (p. 43)</span>. However, instead of selling items for ten times the price listed in the _Player’s Handbook_, Bildrath sells them for only twice the price, citing the recent economic upheaval. 

If any players were kind to him in the tavern, he instead sells those players items at the normal price listed in the *Player's Handbook*—a special deal, for them only. If any players defended Ismark in the tavern, Bildrath glowers at them and instead sells those players items at five times the price listed in the _Player’s Handbook_, spitefully claiming them to be a “special deal" for friends of the town’s “great hero."

During the players’ conversation with Bildrath, Parriwimple enters the room carrying a box of wares that Bildrath asked him to fetch. He is excitedly curious about the players’ presence, but Bildrath orders him to return to his bedroom in order to avoid “disturbing the customers."

If Bildrath orders Parriwimple to remove the players from the store, Parriwimple attempts to grapple them and pull them out the door, preferring to avoid violence if at all possible.
## B5f. The Eastern Barricade
### Preparing the Barricade
Shortly after returning to the barricade at the eastern entrance to the village, the players are met by Bildrath and Parriwimple, who are largely as described in <span class="citation">E1. Bildrath’s Mercantile (p. 43)</span>. However, Bildrath also carries a light crossbow (+2 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d8 + 0) piercing damage).

When the players first encounter Parriwimple, read:

<div class="description">
<p>A hulking figure stands at Bildrath’s side—a young man, tall and brawny. His shaggy brown hair falls messily across his face, and his crooked teeth glint in the grey light. Though muscles ripple beneath his tunic, there's a lightness and immaturity to his posture that belies his strength and size. He fidgets with the hem of his tunic as your eyes fall upon him.</p>
</div>

Bildrath greets the players warmly or coldly, depending on their interaction at the Blood of the Vine Tavern and (if they visited him there) Bildrath's Mercantile. Regardless of Bildrath’s disposition, Parriwimple is glad to meet new friends.

> [!profile]+ **Profile: Parriwimple**
>
> **Roleplaying Information**
> ***Resonance.*** Parriwimple should inspire sympathy for the loss of his parents, endearment for his childlike mannerisms and optimistic perseverance, and flattery for his fascination with the players’ exotic weapons and clothes.
>
> ***Emotions.*** Parriwimple most often feels curiosity, hope, wonder, melancholy, and confusion.
>
> ***Motivations.*** Parriwimple wants to help his friends and neighbors, take care of his Uncle Bildrath, and honor his late parents’ memories.
>
> ***Inspirations.*** When playing Parriwimple, channel Lenny Small (*Of Mice and Men*) and Forrest Gump (*Forrest Gump*).
>
> **Character Information**
> ***Persona.*** To the world, Parriwimple is a cheerful, simple-minded young man. To those he trusts, Parriwimple is a thoughtful, insightful, yet grieving orphan, desperate to move past his parents’ deaths by proving useful to others.
>
> ***Morale.*** In a fight, Parriwimple would hold up his hands and plead for peace. If ignored, however, he would swiftly use his strength to restrain any combatants—with righteous fury if defending his uncle Bildrath.
>
> ***Relationships.*** Parriwimple is an orphan and the nephew of the general-store owner Bildrath Cantemir.

Bildrath is pleased to see the players’ delivery of *fire bottles*. He can inform the players that they have been assigned to defend the eastern barricade from any smaller bands of undead that might drift around the edges of the village rather than attacking from the north, south, or west.

If any of the players treated him kindly at the Blood of the Vine Tavern or Bildrath's Mercantile, Bildrath instructs Parriwimple to present them with a crate containing two bags of ball bearings, two bags of caltrops, ten iron spikes, and three flasks of oil from his shop, to be used in preparing the barricade for the siege. (See <span class="citation">Adventuring Gear (Player’s Handbook, p. 148)</span> for more information regarding these items.) Bildrath also directs the players to a pair of ten-foot ladders nailed to one of the houses nearby, which can allow any ranged combatants to ascend to the house’s roof. Finally, Bildrath instructs Parriwimple to obey those players’ instructions as though they were his own.

> [!info]+ **The Barricade**
> The barricade the players have been assigned to defend is a thirty-foot-long, six-foot-tall assembly of tree logs, piled furniture, and nailed wooden planks. Each five-foot-long section of the barricade has AC 15, 10 hit points, and immunity to piercing, psychic, and poison damage. 
>
> Wooden platforms scattered across the western side of the barricade allow defenders to peer over the edge and attack approaching enemies. While behind the barricade, defenders have full cover, or three-quarters cover while standing on a platform.
### The Siege
Dusk falls soon after the players complete their preparations. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>As the last shades of light fade from the sky, an eerie silence descends upon the village. A chill wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it the faint scent of decay as the leaves of the Svalich Woods rustle in the distance.</p>
<p>A blood-curdling howl pierces the night, followed by a second—and then a third. The cacophony of inhuman shrieks and moans grows louder, echoing across the basin from all directions as the distant forest seems to come alive.</p>
</div>

If he is present, Bildrath’s face grows grim, and he grips his crossbow tightly. “It begins," he mutters, as the din fades once more into the cold night. Parriwimple nods in determination, clutching his spear closer to his chest.

> [!info]+ **A Moonless Night**
> At night, torches mounted at ten-foot intervals along the barricade illuminate the surrounding area out to a distance of forty feet. On the night of the siege, thick cloud cover obscures the moonlight, preventing defenders without darkvision from seeing any approaching creatures in the darkness.

> [!abstract]+ **Holding the Line**
> If the zombies successfully break through the barricade, Parriwimple attempts to hold the choke point with his spear, though he’s grateful for any aid the players might provide.

> [!info]+ **Undead Fortitude**
> Revise each **zombie** and **zombie plague spreader’s** ***undead fortitude*** feature to read as follows:
>
> * ***Undead Fortitude (1/day).*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead. The zombie can’t use this ability if the damage is radiant or from a critical hit, or if the damage taken is 15 or more.

  
> [!combat]- **Balancing the Siege** 
> Due to the wave mechanic, this combat encounter is a series of two consecutive **mild** combat encounters and a third **bloody** combat encounter against a party of five 3rd-level players, a CR 0 ally (Bildrath), and a CR 5 ally (Parriwimple), the first of which will consume approximately 15% of their total maximum hit points, the second of which will consume approximately 17% of their total maximum hit points, and the third of which will consume approximately 34% of their maximum hit points (for a total of 66% of their maximum hit points). For parties of smaller or larger sizes, modify the encounter as follows: 
> * **Three Players**. Reduce the number of zombies in the first wave to 5. Remove the zombies in the second wave. Replace the wight in the third wave with a ghoul. 
> * **Four Players**. Reduce the number of zombies in the first wave to five. Reduce the number of zombies in the second wave to one. Replace the wight in the third wave with three zombies. 
> * **Six Players**. Increase the number of zombies in the first wave to seven. Increase the number of zombies in the second wave to three. Add one zombie to the third wave.

***The First Wave.*** Not long after darkness falls, six **zombies** emerge from the darkness and approach the barricade. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>Six figures shamble toward the barricade, the whites of their eyes glinting in the torchlight. Their low, guttural moans echo through the night, their rotting arms outstretched toward you.</p>
</div>

In combat, the zombies focus their attacks on the barricade, attempting to batter it down with their **slam** attacks. Once the zombies have broken a hole in the barricade, they attempt to flood through it, attacking any defenders who stand in their way.

***The Second Wave.*** At the beginning of the third round of combat after the first wave arrives, two additional **zombies** emerge from the darkness, joined by two **ghouls**. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>Two more zombies shamble from the gloom, flanked by a pair of gaunt, feral, humanoid creatures with razor-sharp claws and hungry, glowing eyes. These ghouls move with a predatory grace, their lipless mouths revealing rows of pointed teeth as they release shrieking howls that echo through the night.</p>
</div>

The zombies again attempt to batter down the barricade, while the ghouls attempt to climb over it using their claws.

***The Third Wave.*** At the beginning of the seventh round of combat after the first wave arrives, a **wight** and a **zombie plague spreader** <span class="citation">(<em>Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft</em>, p. 255)</span> approach the barricade. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A lone undead shambles slowly from the darkness, its white eyes staring dully past the flickering torchlight. Its flesh, though rotting, is a smooth, sickly white, its skin run through with raised, crimson veins. A faint cloud of reddish mist spills continually from its mouth and down onto the bloodstained earth before dissipating into the air.</p>
</div>

> [!info]+ **The Plague Spreader**
> Increase the **plague spreader's** hit points to 130, decrease the necrotic damage dealt by its ***slam*** to 5 (1d8), and decrease the damage dealt by its ***virulent miasma*** to 7 (2d6) poison damage per creature. 
>
> In addition, revise its ***virulent miasma*** action such that a Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points doesn’t automatically die, and instead only rises as a zombie if it dies before stabilizing or regaining hit points. The DC for stabilizing a creature reduced to 0 hit points in this way increases to 20.

The plague spreader first approaches the players as closely as possible, then releases its ***virulent miasma***, attempting to hit as many creatures as possible. (If possible, aim to ensure that the miasma hits Bildrath, to make sure the players understand the nature of its attack. Neither Bildrath nor Parriwimple have seen or heard of a zombie plague spreader before, and both are ignorant of the virus it carries.) After the plague spreader uses its miasma, the red mist stops spilling from its mouth.

Meanwhile, the wight attacks from the darkness beyond the torches’ light, making ***longbow*** attacks from 60 feet away. If the players engage the plague spreader in melee combat or reduce it to 90 hit points or fewer, the wight draws its ***longsword*** and engages the players directly.
## B5g. The Western Barricade
### The Raven’s Guidance
Shortly after the players dispatch the final wave, the **wereraven** Muriel appears to them in **raven** form. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A small, dark silhouette plunges from the skies above, resolving into the form of a familiar raven, its blue-tipped wings flashing in the torchlight. Its eyes are wide and panicked, and an urgent, desperate shriek sounds repeatedly from its wide-open beak.</p>
</div>

Although she can’t speak in raven form, Muriel attempts to nonverbally alert the players that the western barricade has fallen, pulling their hair and clothes toward the town square. If the players don’t immediately follow, read:

<div class="description">
<p>You hear terrified shouts in the distance, and the sound of crunching wood.<p>
</div>

### Ismark’s Last Stand
If the players follow her, Muriel guides them west toward the town square, then leads them through a series of alleyways behind and around the Blood of the Vine tavern, finally emerging on the north side of the street just west of the town square. When the players arrive, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Dozens of bodies litter the street, bloody and unmoving. The air is thick with the pungent scent of rot and death, and the howling wind sings with the sound of terrified screams.</p>
<p>The barricade protecting the town square has been shattered, its splintered remains surrounded by a mound of corpses nearly six feet high. In the square, children scream as the elderly and infirm watch with muted horror.</p>
<p>The torches to the west have been extinguished, the town’s western defenders fled—or killed. Only one figure remains standing: Ismark, his clothes torn and bloody, bearing a longsword in his left hand and a shortsword in his right. Twenty feet away from him stands a pale-skinned zombie, its flesh a smooth, sickly white that bulges with crimson veins. Its eyes stare dully toward the tents in the town square beyond, and, as a cloud of reddish mist spills gently from its gaping mouth, it takes a shambling step forward.</p>

Ismark, who has been reduced to 40 hit points, welcomes any help the players can provide against the plague spreader. If reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, Ismark obstructs the plague spreader directly while taking the Dodge action on each of his turns, hoping to delay it while providing the players sufficient time to defeat it.

The plague spreader, which begins 120 feet from the center of the town square and has the same modifications as the plague spreader in [[#The Siege]], won’t use its ***viral miasma*** until it reaches the center of the town square or is reduced to 30 hit points or fewer. Each round, it attempts to move its full speed in a straight line toward the town square. If it can’t, it uses its ***multiattack*** to attack any creatures within reach. (The plague spreader doesn’t attempt to move around creatures obstructing it, even if doing so could allow it to reach its destination.)
  
> [!combat]- **Balancing the Town Square** 
> This combat encounter is a **mild** combat encounter against a party of five 3rd-level players and a CR 3 ally (Ismark Kolyanovich), and will consume approximately 16% of their total maximum hit points. For parties of smaller or larger sizes, modify the encounter as follows: 
> * **Three Players**. Decrease the zombie plague spreader’s hit points to 93, remove the necrotic damage from its Slam attacks, and decrease the damage of its virulent miasma to 2d4. 
> * **Four Players**. Decrease the zombie plague spreader’s hit points to 112 and decrease the necrotic damage of its unarmed strikes to 1d6. 
> * **Six Players**. Add one zombie fighting alongside the plague spreader.

> [!info]+ **Dying NPCs**
>
> As noted in Monsters and Death (<span class="citation">Player's Handbook, p. 198</span>), allied non-player characters—such as Ismark Kolyanovich and any other NPC fighting alongside the players—should fall unconscious upon being reduced to 0 hit points. When they do, they follow the same rules for death saving throws as player characters, described further in Death Saving Throws (<span class="citation">Player's Handbook, p. 197</span>).
### Rahadin’s Proclamation
Shortly after the players defeat the plague spreader, a lone horseman flanked by twelve **zombies** approaches the town square from the west. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>You hear the sound of hoofsteps squelching through mud. From the shadows on the western road emerges a cloaked man riding an ash-gray horse with dull, shadowed eyes. Behind it trail a dozen shambling undead, flanking the horseman with six to a side.</p>
<p>The flickering torchlight paints the man’s features in shades of burning orange and red, revealing a tall, lithe figure of dusky complexion, with long, black hair that falls past his neck. A light cloak is draped across his shoulders, its edge rimmed with thick, white fur, and gloves of supple black leather cover his hands. A deep blue tunic trimmed with bronze is visible beneath a layer of tough, yet flexible leather armor, and a curved saber hangs from a sheath at his belt, with a pair of scimitars strapped to his back above it.</p>
<p>His ears taper sharply upward to elven points, and his dark, brown eyes bear a quiet awareness and a casual, almost predatory gaze as they shift slowly across his surroundings. A long, wicked scar cuts across his forehead, just above where lines have begun to mark his face with age, and his lips are pulled back into a thin, perpetual frown.</p>
</div>

This is Rahadin, riding his *phantom steed*. As he comes to a halt at the edge of the town square, he pulls a scroll from his cloak and unfurls. If not interrupted, he begins to read from it, his resonant voice carrying across the square:

<div class="description">
<p>"Five score and seven days past, this people rose in unlawful rebellion against Strahd von Zarovich, Count of Barovia, Master of Castle Ravenloft, and Protector of the Balinok Mountains. For this treasonous act, this settlement has been met with righteous punishment, so that its inhabitants might learn the weight of their defiance.</p>
<p>"Witnessed by the eyes of the dead and damned, this price has been extracted in blood, common and noble alike. Let it be known that on this day, the mercy of Strahd von Zarovich extends once more unto those who return to their fief and field—while those who continue in their folly shall be swept away as chaff before the wind."</p>
</div>

If not prevented, Rahadin searches the crowd, his gaze finally settling on Ismark. Leaving the undead behind, he approaches Ismark on horseback. 

As Rahadin approaches the players (or vice—versa), the players can hear the sounds of his ***deathly choir.*** Read: 

<div class="description">
<p>It begins with a dull roar—a prickle at the edge of your awareness, like the washing of the ocean against the shore. As the man grows closer, however, the muffled sound grows ever—more insistent, amplifying and building upon itself—until it resolves from a more innocuous sound, almost like waves, into a torrent of screams.</p>
<p>Your ears fill with a cacophony of a thousand voices, pleading, suffering, dying: a psychic onslaught that crashes against your mind from every direction, leaving little room for thought. The man, however, remains unflinching—seemingly undisturbed by the symphony of screams that surrounds him.</p>
</div>

The players can notice that any other Barovians within ten feet of Rahadin appear to be similarly disturbed. (Any Barovians beyond the ten—foot radius can’t hear the screams.) When Rahadin speaks, the screams somewhat recede—enough to allow him and others to be heard—but gain a notable accent of fear.

Upon approaching Ismark, Rahadin inspects him briefly, then states coldly: “Please accept my congratulations on your new position—and my condolences on your loss." Unless obstructed, he then turns his horse around and departs the village, once more trailed by the twelve **zombies**.

Rahadin’s initial proclamation leaves Ismark stiff and stone-faced, but his subsequent greeting leaves Ismark shell-shocked and frozen. Shortly after Rahadin departs, Ismark appears to process the weight of Rahadin’s words, releases a bellowing, wordless cry, and runs for the burgomaster’s mansion. (If Parriwimple is present, he urges the players to follow Ismark.)

> [!abstract]+ **The Players Challenge Rahadin**
> Rahadin takes little interest in the players. If challenged, he states merely that the siege was “the will of Strahd," and informs the players that it is “not for them to question the actions of their betters." If asked his identity, he shares only that he is Rahadin, chamberlain of Castle Ravenloft, and a humble servant of Strahd von Zarovich.
>
> If grappled, restrained, or attacked, Rahadin first commands them to “cease their foolishness," noting that “in the spirit of the night’s mercy, and in light of their foreign nature," he is not unwilling to overlook their disobedience on this single occasion. If the interfering player continues their interference, Rahadin swiftly and efficiently dispatches them. 
>
> Once an interfering player has been knocked unconscious, Rahadin uses the pommel of his saber to slam their wrist, knee, or ribs, temporarily causing that player to gain the effects of one of the following <span class="citation">Lingering Injuries (<em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>, p. 272)</span>: **Lose an Arm or Hand**, **Lose a Foot or Leg**, or **Internal Injury**. This injury lasts until the player has completed two long rests.

<p><strong><em>Screams of the Dead.</em></strong> Any creature within 10 feet of Rahadin that isn't protected by a <em>mind blank</em> spell hears in its mind the screams of the thousands of people Rahadin has killed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fey Ancestry.</em></strong> Rahadin has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put him to sleep.</p>
<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (1/day).</em></strong> If Rahadin would fail a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> If Rahadin would be paralyzed or stunned, he is slowed instead. (His speed is halved, he has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and creatures have advantage on attacks made against him.)
<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> Rahadin's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence. He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:<br>
- 3/day: phantom steed<br>
- 1/day: nondetection</p>
<p><strong><em>Mask of the Wild.</em></strong> Rahadin can attempt to hide even when he is only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>
<p><strong><em>Murderous Instinct.</em></strong> When Rahadin drops to 0 hit points, he stows his saber and draws his twin scimitars, <em>Thorn</em> and <em>Chain</em>. His statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of his second form. His initiative count doesn't change. Excess damage doesn't carry over to his new form, and he doesn’t retain any conditions he had in his previous form.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Rahadin makes two attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Saber.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (1d8 + 6) slashing damage, and Rahadin can push the target up to 5 feet away. Instead of pushing the target, Rahadin can force it to succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Poisoned Dart.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (1d4 + 6 plus 2d4) piercing and poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of Rahadin's next turn.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Wind Strike.</em></strong> Rahadin moves up to his speed in a straight line toward an unoccupied space he can see, including through enemy spaces, without provoking opportunity attacks. Each creature within 5 feet of a space he passes through must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Whirling Blades.</em></strong> Each creature within 10 feet of Rahadin must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Rahadin can take up to three reactions per round, though no more than one per turn. If Rahadin would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Punishing Strike.</em></strong> When Rahadin is hit by a melee or ranged attack, he can use his reaction to move up to his speed toward the attacker and make an attack with his saber. This movement doesn't trigger opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Disarm.</em></strong> When an enemy misses Rahadin with a melee attack while wielding a weapon, he can use his reaction to force that enemy to make a DC 19 Strength saving throw, with advantage if the enemy is holding the weapon with two hands. On a failure, the enemy drops the item, which is knocked 10 feet away.</p>
<p><strong><em>Misty Step (1/round).</em></strong> When an enemy misses Rahadin with an attack or deals damage to him, he can use his reaction to cast <em>misty step</em>. He can then immediately take the Hide action. Rahadin doesn't need to see his destination when casting <em>misty step</em> in this way.</p>
<p><strong><em>Psychic Scream (1/day).</em></strong> When Rahadin is reduced to 0 hit points, he can use his reaction to cause his deathly choir to release a terrible scream. Each creature within 60 feet of Rahadin must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) psychic damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also stunned until the start of Rahadin's next turn.</p>

(A bleeding target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or take an additional 1d6 slashing damage. On a success or upon receiving magical healing, the target is no longer bleeding.)

## B5h. Return to the Mansion
### Strahd’s Aftermath
If the players follow Ismark to the burgomaster’s mansion, they find its grounds abandoned and the front door ajar. Upon arriving, Ismark rushes inside, shouting for his father and Ireena.

Ismark and the players can find Kolyan and Ireena in the first-floor parlor. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A red pool surrounds the burgomaster’s unmoving form, his glassy eyes staring unseeing toward the ceiling as blood drips from a long, elegant slash across his chest. Not far away, Ireena lies crumpled across the carpet beneath a boarded-up window, its ragged curtains drifting lazily in the cold wind.</p>
</div>

Upon arriving, Ismark lets out a strangled cry of anguish, and immediately descends to cradle his father’s head in his hands.

Kolyan is obviously dead. A player who inspects Ireena and checks her breath or pulse finds that she is alive, but pale and weak, with two bloody puncture wounds piercing the flesh of her neck.

Shortly after the players arrive, Ireena stirs awake, shrieking in despair when she sees her father’s corpse. If asked, she can share the following information, though she readily admits that her memory is hazy:

* As the siege progressed, she returned to the manor to retrieve a fresh quiver of crossbow bolts. As she returned to the door, she heard her father inviting someone to enter their home. (“Father’s voice sounded strange," she whispers, holding her arms to her chest. “He was calm—too calm—like someone else was speaking for him.")
* Though she doesn’t remember who the visitor was, she remembers a tall, gaunt silhouette; a deep, resonant voice; and a set of burning, hypnotic red eyes.
* The voice—a man’s—spoke to her, and her memory went blank. She remembers feeling a sudden, sharp pain on her neck, followed by the sound of her father shouting. As she fell into unconsciousness, she recalls hearing the voice murmur, “We shall meet again."

Ireena is horrified by her father’s death and the prospect that their home was visited by the Devil, Strahd von Zarovich. She is bewildered as to why Strahd might kill her father but spare her, and is deeply disturbed by the prospect that she is somehow responsible for Kolyan’s fate.

Once the players have sufficiently comforted the siblings, Ismark exhaustedly asks the players to remain at the mansion with Ireena while he returns to the town square to ensure that any wounded Barovians are cared for. “We will see to our father’s burial tomorrow," he adds, quietly. "And if you can—try to get some sleep. You've more than earned it."
### The Argument
Ismark returns to the manor shortly before midnight. Shortly thereafter, any players who remain awake, or who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 15 or greater, overhear a muffled argument from the kitchen below. 

The players can eavesdrop on this conversation with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) check or a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>The murmurs from the next room are largely indistinct, obscured by the low groans of the old house's timbers. As you strain your ears, however, the siblings' words come slowly into focus.</p>
<p>Ireena's voice, sharp with indignation, pierces the silence. "You have no right, Ismark. You can't just decide to send me away, like I'm some kind of inconvenience! I'm Father's child as much as you, and our people need me to rebuild. You need me too!"</p>
<p>Ismark's reply is measured, though laced with an unmistakable note of worry. "The Devil has his sights set on you—and even if we don't believe the legend about women with red hair, others might. Barovia just isn't safe for you anymore."</p>
<p>A snort of defiance echoes from the other side of the thin wooden partition. "I am no coward, Ismark, and I will not abandon our friends and neighbors in their hour of need."</p>
<p>There's a pause. Then, Ismark says, quietly, "Gertruda left the village this morning. Alone."</p>
<p>You hear a ragged breath from Ireena's direction. "<em>Why?</em>"</p>
<p>"Her mother thinks she went to the castle—probably to seek clemency for the village from the Devil," Ismark murmurs.</p>
<p>There's a long, suffering silence. Then—</p>
<p>Ismark seems to hesitate, his words slightly fumbled. "I'm not asking you to abandon them. But there are others who need your help. Think about our neighbors who fled for Vallaki. They need guidance, advocacy—and perhaps a leader to bring them home one day."</p>
<p>There is a long pause. Ireena's voice is low when she finally speaks—barely even audible. "I still don't like it."</p>
<p>Ismark's response is quiet. "It's your choice. I can't take that away from you. But after losing Father, I can't . . . I can't bear the thought of losing you too."</p>
<p>The silence that follows is palpable, weighted with unspoken emotions. Finally, Ireena's voice breaks it, fragile and quiet. "I will go. If only for you. And only if we bury Father first—together."</p>
</div>

Ismark and Ireena ascend the stairs a few moments later. A player with a passive Wisdom (Insight) score of 10 or more notices that both have blotchy, red eyes, as if from crying.

If confronted, Ismark can reluctantly share the following information:

* He no longer believes that Barovia, surrounded by suspicious neighbors and in the shadow of the Devil’s keep, is safe for Ireena.
* Instead, Ismark intends for Ireena to travel to Vallaki, a fortified town to the west. St. Andral’s Church in Vallaki is said to be hallowed ground, protecting its congregants from vampires and other undead.

When the player returns to their room, they can see two **swarms of bats**—Strahd's spies—gathered on the eaves of a nearby house, watching silently from the darkness.
### Morning at the Mansion
The players' rest at the mansion passes without incident. When they awaken the following morning, they can find the burgomasters' corpse lying in a coffin in the living room as described in <span class="citation">E4. Burgomaster's Mansion (p. 44)</span>. Ismark and Ireena are in the dining room, quietly drinking tea.

When the players descend to the main floor, Ireena greet them and insists on fixing them bowls of goat's milk porridge and cups of chamomile tea for breakfast. While Ireena busies herself in the kitchen, Ismark solemnly and apologetically asks the players for three favors.

***Escorting Ireena.*** Ismark first quietly notes that Ireena appears to have become a target for both the Devil and her fellow villagers, and that he no longer believes the village, which lies directly beneath the shadow of Castle Ravenloft, to be safe for her. 

Ismark shares the information regarding his desire to bring her to Vallaki as described in <span class="citation">Roleplaying Ismark (p. 43)</span>, and notes that St. Andral’s Church in Vallaki is said to be hallowed ground, protecting its congregants from vampires and other undead. Although he can't leave Barovia due to his duties as his father's successor, Ismark asks the players if they would be willing to bring her to St. Andral's Church in his stead. 

> [!warning]+ **Clarifying Expectations**
> 
> *Curse of Strahd: Reloaded* is a campaign about heroes. It's also a campaign about making allies, and the bonds and strength that grow from those alliances.
> 
> As such, while Ireena is not an essential NPC to the campaign, a party that declines Ismark's request likely has mismatched expectations with the type of campaign you plan to run. If the players refuse to escort Ireena to Vallaki, pause the game and check in with them to clarify and confirm expectations. If the players are still reluctant to bring Ireena with them, ask questions and discuss the issue further before resuming the game.

***Seeking Madam Eva.*** Strahd's attack on the village has only strengthened Ismark's belief that the Barovians must find some way of escaping the vampire's tyranny. "We can't go on living like this," he croaks, his knuckles whitening as he stares into his mug. "I've heard how terrible things were a hundred years ago, before he went to sleep. Vampires lurking in every shadow. Parents and their children disappearing in the night. Rats and wolves and bats reporting our every move to the castle. Even if the Devil goes dormant again in fifty or sixty years' time, who would we be if we condemned our children and grandchildren to that same fate?"

Although he asks them to be discreet in doing so, so as to avoid drawing Strahd's wrath back down upon the village, Ismark asks the players to seek the wisdom of Madam Eva, a Vistani seer and sage who dwells at Tser Pool. "If anyone might know how the Devil can be destroyed and our people freed," he murmurs, "it's her."

If the players agree to do so, the player with the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score notices a **rat**—one of Strahd's spies—watching them with rapt, malevolent, and intelligent interest from beneath a nearby piece of furniture. Once noticed, the rat immediately dashes toward the kitchen in a clear attempt to escape.

The players have one round to kill the rat as it scurries toward a large hole in the kitchen wall. If they fail to do so, Ireena skewers it with her rapier before it can do so, recognizing it as one of Strahd's spies.

***Delivering the Coffin.*** After asking his first two favors, Ismark asks the players to assist him and Ireena in carrying Kolyan's coffin to the church. If they do, the two siblings accompany the players to the church.
## B5i. The Barovian Church
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 3: Area E5.</em></span>

When the players arrive at the church with the burgomaster’s body, [[Non-Player Characters#Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is disturbed by the damage wrought to its walls and roof. As he knocks on the front door and calls for Father Donavich, if Parriwimple is still alive, read the following:

<div class="description">
<p>As Ismark's knock echoes through the cold air, a voice rings out from the darkened street: "He won't come out."</p>
<p>A hulking silhouette steps forward from the mist—Parriwimple.</p>
</div>

If Bildrath died in the siege, add:

<div class="description">
<p>Parriwimple's clothes are still disheveled and bloodstained, and his cheeks are blotchy and red.</p>
</div>

Parriwimple, who is out for a walk ("It helps me think," he mumbles, if asked), can share the following information if asked:

* Father Donavich used to be a kind and friendly man, always ready to share a word of wisdom or a warm crabapple pie with visitors. 
* Ever since the siege started, however, Donavich shut himself inside the church and turned away visitors more often than not. When Parriwimple last saw him two days ago, Donavich looked like he hadn’t slept or bathed in almost a week.
* Father Donavich hasn’t worn his holy symbol (a bronze sunburst) since the rebellion, which Parriwimple considers odd. (Parriwimple always loved how the light would glint off of its surface, and adored hearing Donavich’s son, Doru, tell stories of how the sun once shone in Barovia.)
* Parriwimple misses Doru, who left to lead the rebellion against Strahd three months ago alongside the stranger, Alanik. (Parriwimple also misses Alanik’s pet monkey, which he loved to play with.) Despite his uncle telling him that Doru died at Castle Ravenloft, Parriwimple hopes that he somehow survived.

Parriwimple won’t accompany the players inside of the church, but wishes them well and invites them to visit him at Bildrath’s Mercantile before departing. 
### Inside the Church
This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">Church (p. 45)</span>. However, modify the descriptive text for <span class="citation">E5a. Hall (p. 45)</span> to remove Doru’s scream: 

<div class="description">
<p>The doors open to reveal a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-long hall leading to a brightly lit chapel. The hall is unlit and reeks of mildew. Four doors, two on each side of the hall, lead to adjacent chambers.</p>
<p>You can see that the chapel is strewn with debris, and you hear a soft voice from within reciting a prayer.</p>
</div>

Doru does not cry out to his father when the players enter the chapel. Instead, when the players first approach the chapel, Donavich’s prayers halt. Add the following line to the chapel’s description in place of Doru’s cry:

<div class="description">
<p>The sound of mumbled prayer stops, and a hoarse, tired voice rings through the chamber from the figure kneeling behind the altar. “I cannot offer the blessing you seek. Go, and leave this accursed place in peace."</p>
</div>

> [!lore]+ **A Recent History of the Church**
>
> Father Donavich was no supporter of Doru’s march on Castle Ravenloft. A mild and soft-spoken man, Donavich feared that Doru would meet only his end beyond the walls of the keep. To keep his son safe, however, and as a token of his love, Donavich gave Doru his holy symbol, as well as his blessing.
>
> Donavich’s holy symbol, however, did little to protect his son. When Strahd began his siege on the village of Barovia two weeks ago, his undead forces were not alone: Strahd also sent Doru, now a freshly turned **vampire spawn**, to terrorize the church and torment his father. Donavich barely managed to lure and trap Doru in the undercroft, where he remains imprisoned still.
>
> Since Doru returned, Father Donavich has been unable to cast any spells and no longer feels the Morninglord’s presence when he prays. When Strahd sent Doru back to Barovia, he allowed Doru to continue wearing his father’s holy symbol as a cruel joke. As a result, Donavich wrongly believes that Doru’s undead nature has corrupted his symbol—and, therefore, his relationship with the Morninglord—and so prevented him from reaching the Morninglord’s divine grace.
>
> In fact, however, it is Father Donavich’s own loss of faith that hinders him—a crisis that blinds him to an even starker truth. Donavich believes that his son, Doru, is dead, and that the **vampire spawn** trapped in the undercroft is a foul and profane beast that wears Doru’s skin. He is mistaken: though his body is now undead, Doru’s soul is very much alive.
>
> Though he cannot ignore Strahd’s direct commands, and though his thirst for blood weighs heavily on his thoughts and actions, Doru continues to fight bitterly against his own vampiric nature. Though he doesn’t always succeed, it was this resistance that allowed his father to entrap him in the undercroft at all. When hope rises in him, Doru calls out to his father to release him, pleading for salvation and forgiveness. Donavich, however, has so far refused to respond.
>
> Doru continues to wear his father’s holy symbol, both to reassure himself that they will one day reconcile and to steel his will when the vampire’s urges rise too strongly within. His ability to resist the call of blood has slowly grown since his imprisonment—but so too has his exhaustion, exacerbated by slow starvation. Now, Doru’s sanity balances on a knife’s edge, and a simple push could mean salvation—or damnation.

If he learns that Ismark and Ireena are with the players, Donavich acts more warmly toward them and apologizes for the chapel’s state of disrepair. 

As the conversation unfolds, the following exchanges might occur:

* If Ismark, Ireena, or a player asks about burying the deceased burgomaster, Father Donavich informs them that he would be glad to oversee a burial, but that he cannot perform the holy rites that would sanctify Kolyan’s remains. (Donavich is sorrowful to hear of Kolyan’s death, and expresses his condolences for his passing.)
* If Ismark, Ireena, or a player notes the damage done to the church, Father Donavich informs them that it was caused by a **vampire spawn** that attacked amidst the siege—the undead husk of his son, Doru. (Both Ismark and Ireena are shocked and horrified to learn of Doru's fate, having believed he died at Castle Ravenloft.)
* If Ismark, Ireena, or a player informs him that Gertruda (Doru's betrothed) has gone missing, Father Donavich mourns her and murmurs a quiet prayer that the Morninglord keep and protect her soul.

If the players inquire further, Donavich can share the following information:

* When Doru set off for Castle Ravenloft, Father Donavich gave him his holy symbol of the Morninglord—a bronze sunburst on a leather cord—to keep him safe in the face of darkness. When Doru failed to return, however, Donavich feared the worst.
* Six days ago, as the siege was beginning, Doru returned to the church at midnight, now transformed into a **vampire spawn**. Donavich managed to lure Doru into the undercroft and trap him there.
* Ever since Doru returned, Donavich hasn’t been able to cast spells or feel the Morninglord’s presence. He believes that this is because Doru still has his holy symbol, and that Strahd’s foul influence has corrupted Donavich’s connection to the gods.
* Donavich believes that his son is dead, and that the creature that wears his skin is a mockery that must be destroyed.

Donavich knows that he can’t defeat Doru and can’t bear to see his son’s face again. If the players are willing, however, Donavich asks them to descend to the undercroft, destroy Doru’s body, and retrieve his holy symbol. In exchange, Donavich offers to complete the proper burial rites and to tell the players of a place where they can find safety from the Devil Strahd.

If the players agree, Donavich produces the key to the padlock in <span class="citation">E5d. Trapdoor (p. 45)</span> and allows them to enter. (Ismark remains upstairs with Ireena, reluctant to expose her to a vampire—even Doru—but promises the players that he will join them should Doru prove too dangerous for them to handle. A DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that he also appears too horrified by Doru's fate to face him directly.)
### Descent to the Undercroft
The undercroft is largely as described in <span class="citation">E5g. Undercroft (p. 47)</span>. However, modify the last sentence of the description as follows: 

<div class="description">
<p>Candlelight from the chapel above slips through the cracks, but there's no sign of any creature in the gloom.</p>
</div>

Doru, a **vampire spawn**, has used his ***spider climb*** feature to cling to the ceiling at the sound of the players’ approach. A player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher automatically spots him in the darkened upper corner on the far side of the room. Otherwise, read the following after one round has passed.

<div class="description">
<p>A young man’s voice, strained and tired, echoes from the darkness above. “You’ve come to kill me, haven’t you?"</p>
</div>

Doru prefers to speak with the players from the safety of darkness, but won’t refuse if the players command him to reveal himself. If he does, read the following:

<div class="description">
<p>From the darkness of the cross beams above, a figure unfurls itself like a moth from its cocoon, moving like a spider as it lowers itself slowly to the ground. As it comes into the faint light, the shadow resolves into the form of a young man, his youthful features strikingly reminiscent of Father Donavich.</p>
<p>His skin is ghostly pale, with dirt and grime streaked across his face. His clothes are ripped and worn, and his hair is an unkempt mess of tangles and knots. His eyes are red and bloodshot, his gaze darting from face to face. A leather cord hangs around his neck, holding a bloodstained bronze sunburst that rests against his chest. He swallows and licks his lips—and a pair of pointed fangs pokes through.</p>
<p>"If you want to kill me, I won't stop you," he says, his voice cracking. "But I just have one request first."</p>
</div>

> [!info]+ **Doru Will Remember That**

> When the players’ conversation with Doru begins, secretly place a six-sided die on the table, with its top face showing a one. Each time the players antagonize or discourage Doru, increase the number on the die by one. Each time the players are encouraging or kind, decrease the number on the die by one. (The number can’t go below zero or above six.)
>
> If the players agree to perform Doru’s experiment, roll a second six-sided die when the experiment begins. If the result on the second die is equal to or greater than the number on the first, Doru resists his vampiric addiction and the test ends successfully. If the result on the second die is less than the number on the first, however, Doru succumbs to his bloodlust and attacks the source of the blood.
>
> For example, if the players antagonize Doru twice and offer no kindness or encouragement, the first die should show a three. If the second die rolls a one or a two, Doru attacks.

Doru’s request is simple: to prove to himself that he can control his vampiric urges, he wants the players to expose him to the scent of fresh blood. If he can refrain from attacking for a full minute, he wants the players to tell Father Donavich that his son is still alive. If he can’t, he wants the players to kill him. In either case, he won’t stop the players from taking the holy symbol once the experiment is complete.

> [!abstract] **The Players Attack**
> Doru doesn't fight to defend himself if attacked. Instead, he curls into a ball at the end of the room and pleads for the players to give him a chance—just one chance—to prove himself. If the players decline, Doru whimpers for his father to save him as he dies, though his pleas go unheard and unheeded.

Doru can also share the following information with the players if asked:

* As a child, Doru was enraptured by stories of the sun and the light and hope that it once brought to the valley. As he grew older, he learned swordsmanship from Ismark and studied the book *Van Richten’s Guide to Vampires* to learn how to destroy the undead. He dreamed of one day destroying the Devil of Castle Ravenloft and bringing freedom to his people.
* Sixteen weeks ago, a foreign scholar calling himself Alanik Ray arrived in Barovia and rented a room in the burgomaster's manor. When an enormous undead dire wolf attacked a group of children who had strayed too far from the village, however, Doru alone saw "Alanik" fend it off with expert skill—and when the wolf knocked the hat off of "Alanik's" head, his appearance magically changed, revealing him to be the legendary vampire hunter Dr. Rudolph van Richten.
* Doru confronted him and insisted that Van Richten lead the village in revolt against Castle Ravenloft. Though Van Richten was reluctant at first, he eventually agreed—on the condition that Doru allow him to keep his disguise. Two days later, Doru, aided by a man named Escher—the village bard and Doru’s oldest friend—had assembled more than two dozen fighters to march on the keep.
* With Van Richten’s aid, the mob struck down any undead guards that tried to stand in their way. However, when they finally opened Strahd’s crypt, Escher was nowhere to be found—and Strahd’s coffin was empty. (If asked, Doru forcefully denies that Escher betrayed them.)
* Shortly thereafter, Strahd emerged from the shadows and attacked the mob with merciless force. Most of Doru’s companions were slain. Doru himself was turned into a vampire spawn, and later learned that Escher had been as well. Doru doesn’t know what happened to Van Richten, but was forced to confess the old man’s identity when Strahd interrogated him later. 
* Doru spent nearly three months at Castle Ravenloft, during which Strahd repeatedly forced him to drink the blood of his former companions. Two weeks ago, Strahd commanded Doru to return to the church and his father. 
* Doru can’t disobey Strahd’s direct orders, and can feel his presence at all times. His vampiric bloodthirst is a constant distraction, and it’s difficult to control his predatory urges and instincts. When he first returned to the church, he was almost grateful that his father had locked him in the undercroft, where he couldn’t do any harm.
* Doru doesn’t know if his soul or body can be saved, but he’s kept his father’s holy symbol to remind him of his faith and family, and to steel his will against the addictions of his new form. If not for that, he suspects that he would have lost control days or even weeks ago. (Doru doesn’t know why Strahd allowed him to keep it, but suspects that Strahd viewed it as a form of ironic amusement.)

If the players ask about his argument with "Alanik," Doru admits, shamefacedly, that he forced Van Richten to accompany his rebels to the castle, threatening to march on Castle Ravenloft with or without Van Richten's help. (An enraged Van Richten ripped out the preface of Doru's copy of *Van Richten's Guide to Vampires*—which Doru bought from a Vistani caravan ten years prior—in order to make a point. "He warned me that faith and books meant nothing in the face of true evil," Doru murmurs. "I should have listened." Doru isn't sure what happened to the rest of the book.)

As the conversation continues, Doru might ask the players:

* whether Escher has been seen in the village, and
* whether Doru’s betrothed, Gertruda, survived the siege.

If told that Gertruda has left the village alone for Vallaki—likely in a misguided effort to save Doru himself—Doru becomes visibly distraught, but hopes aloud that she made the journey safely. He asks the players to look out for her and help bring her home should they find her. Doru feels that he has earned his fate, but believes that Gertruda, a good and compassionate woman, deserves far better.
### Doru's Trial
If the players agree to fulfill Doru’s request by exposing him to fresh blood, he asks them to remain silent while he resists—and to strike him down if he succumbs. When the trial begins, read the following:

<div class="description">
<p>Doru’s muscles tense and he squeezes his eyes shut. A few moments later, his nostrils flare, and a thin line of saliva begins to run down his lips. He whimpers, his clawed fingers flexing and twitching.</p>
<p>"When the shadows come," he whispers, “I will not yield. Darkness is the destroyer, and temptation its weapon. I will face the night and its horrors and await the horizon. For in the light of the Morninglord's love, only light can remain."</p>
<p>Doru's voice shakes, his emaciated body trembling. One fist is clenched at his side, the other squeezing the bloodstained sunburst that lies across his neck.</p>
<p>"In the light of the Morninglord's love," he repeats, gasping for breath. "In the light of the Morninglord's love. Gertruda. Gertruda. ***Gertruda***—"</p>
</div>

If Doru succumbs to the bloodlust (see **Doru Will Remember That** above), he pauses, then attacks. Roll initiative.

Otherwise, if Doru successfully resists the bloodlust, read:

<div class="description">
<p>After what seems like an eternity, Doru's body finally relaxes. His tense muscles seem to uncoil, his breath grows steadier, and the look of strain fades from his face. His eyes remain closed a moment longer, then flutter open—and the fangs in his mouth slowly retract, leaving only an ordinary pair of canines behind.</p>
<p>"I have not yielded," he whispers hoarsely. "Not yet."</p>
</div>

Doru thanks the players and relinquishes the holy symbol without protest. If the players mention it, he is surprised to hear that his fangs have retracted, but recognizes the significance with humility and disbelief. (Doru has, after all, read *Van Richten's Guide to Vampires* many times.)

Doru warns the players that Strahd will likely take an active interest in newcomers to his land, and that they should therefore be careful. As a token of his gratitude, he provides the players with the location of a hidden weapons cache that Van Richten kept in case of emergencies. To reach it, the players must cross the River Ivlis Bridge and travel down the Old Svalich Road three hundred paces south into the woods, until they arrive at an ancient oak tree. They'll find the cache nestled in a hollow beneath the tree's roots.

If the players appear interested in learning more about vampires, Doru can share the information contained in **Born from Death** and **Chained to the Grave** in <span class="citation">Vampire (Monster Manual, p. 297)</span>, as well as the broad details of the **shapechanger***, **regeneration***, and **vampire weaknesses*** features of the **vampire** statblock. Doru notes, however, that the Devil is unlike any other vampire. "He holds powers beyond any ordinary vampire's ken. He is . . . unfathomable." He shudders, his eyes squeezing shut in painful remembrance. (Doru can't share any specifics regarding Strahd's capabilities, only that he seemed to slaughter Doru's friends "in mere moments.")

Before the players depart, Doru asks them once more to tell Father Donavich that his son is still alive. If asked to accompany them upstairs, he declines to do so. "I have sinned with my hubris, and this is my penance," he says softly. "I will leave this prison only when my father allows."
### The Burial
If the players return to Father Donavich with his holy symbol in hand, he accepts it with gratitude.

If the players tell Father Donavich that they killed Doru to obtain the symbol, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Donavich's eyes well up with tears as he clasps the symbol in his hands, holding it so tightly his knuckles begin to turn white. A strangled sob escapes him as he sinks to his knees, cradling the sunburst like an infant. </p>
<p>"My boy—my dear, precious boy," he murmurs, his voice barely above a whisper. "May the Morninglord forgive me for what I've done—and for what I couldn't do." </p>
<p>He swallows and his face tenses, his expression growing as hard as stone. "It had to be done. For his sake—and ours."</p>
</div>

Otherwise, if the players spared Doru and relay his final message, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Donavich stumbles back as if he's been struck, his face pale and his eyes wide with shock. For a moment, he simply stands there, silent—and then the silence is broken by a pained noise, a cross between a gasp and a sob, as he clutches the symbol to his chest. </p>
<p>His eyes glisten as he runs a trembling hand through his hair, a myriad of emotions playing across his face in quick succession: disbelief, rage, grief, shame, and—finally—hope. He sags against a nearby pew, his body shaking with exertion. </p>
<p>"My boy," he chokes out. "He's—he's still my boy?" </p>
</div>

Once he’s received his holy symbol, Father Donavich gladly agrees to conduct Kolyan’s burial.

The cemetery is as described in <span class="citation">E6. Cemetery (p. 48)</span>. At night, it is watched by two **swarms of bats**—spies of Strahd’s—who hang to the eaves of the church and the nearby mausoleums, watching the players.

Upon entering the cemetery, Donavich retrieves four shovels from a shed abutting the church and shares them with the players. When the grave is fully dug and dawn has begun, Donavich offers prayers to the Morninglord, asking for Kolyan’s deliverance in the following refrain:

<div class="description" style="text-align: center;">
<p>O Morninglord</p>
<p>Lord of blessed light and patron of new beginnings</p>
<p>We commend into thy mercy and thy radiance Master Kolyan Indirovich</p>
<p>Now departed hence from us and gone evermore into your glory.</p>
<p>We beseech thee to grant unto him thy mercy and everlasting peace</p>
<p>As thou deliver'st him from this everlasting darkness into infinite light</p>
<p>From pestilence into growth</p>
<p>From shadow into day</p>
<p>And from death into new life.</p>
<p>Grant him entrance into Your land of light and joy</p>
<p>In the fellowship of thy saints</p>
<p>And the brilliance of thy presence</p>
<p>By Your will and grace.</p>
</div>

At the conclusion of Donavich’s prayer, Ismark and Ireena offer the following words in memory of their father:

<div class="description">
<p>Ismark wipes his eyes. "Kolyan Indirovich bore all the qualities of a great burgomaster: he was kind, compassionate, and just. But above all else, he was our father—the man who taught us to choose courage over fear, hope over despair, and laughter over sorrow. Even though he has left us, his lessons and memory never will. May he find rest in the Morninglord's embrace, and may his legacy be never forgotten."</p>
<p>Ireena stares at the grave for a few moments, her fingers twisting anxiously into knots. Finally, she says, quietly, "When you found me, I was a stranger—a child, lost in the woods. You and Mother took me in, cared for me, and loved me as your own. When I asked you why, you only ever said: Because I needed it." She falters, choking on the words, then says: "I can never hope to repay what you gave me. But, just as you did, I will never stop trying to help those who need it."</p>
</div>

Any players who wish to may offer words, prayers, or tributes of their own. 

If he has recovered his holy symbol, Donavich first casts *gentle repose* to sanctify Kolyan’s remains. Donavich then directs the players to lower the coffin into the ground. 

With the burial concluded, Strahd’s bats take off into the air, vanishing up into the mist surrounding the base of Castle Ravenloft.

Donavich takes the bats’ presence as a bad omen. In a surprisingly lucid moment, he warns the players and Ismark of a Barovian superstition that young women with red hair often find that ill luck travels beside them, and asks if Ireena plans to remain in Barovia now that the Devil has awoken. If told that Ireena and the players intend to leave, Donavich suggests the Abbey of St. Markovia in Krezk as an eventual destination. He notes it was once a bastion of good, and may yet still offer some protection.

> [!lore] **Who Knows of the Abbey?**
> All Barovians know that the Abbey of St. Markovia lies in the village of Krezk. Most outside of Krezk are unsure as to whether it still operates, though rumors abound that Strahd destroyed it long ago, leaving nothing more than ghosts to haunt its halls. A few Vallakians, including Father Lucian Petrovich of St. Andral's Church, know that the Abbey was reopened more than one hundred years ago, but none beyond Krezk know that the Abbey's current abbot is the same man who reopened its doors over a century ago. 
### Return to the Mansion
When the players return to the burgomaster’s manor following the burial, Ismark packs them three days' worth of rations in cloth sacks for the journey to come. As he does, Ireena tells the players that she'll be ready to leave at noon. Until then, the players are free to explore the village, shop at Bildrath's Mercantile, or otherwise pass the time.

As Ismark packs the rations, he can share the following information:

* The journey to Vallaki is more than a day's travel if the players plan to visit Tser Pool first, and that Ireena and the players will likely need to spend a night on the road. He recommends doing so at Tser Pool itself.
* Tser Pool is a bit under two hours' journey from Barovia. (Though some Vistani are rumored to be in league with Strahd, Tser Pool is known to be a safe place for travelers to spend the night, especially given Madam Eva's reputation.)
## B5j. Lugdana's Knoll
Approximately an hour before noon, [[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] quietly slips out of the mansion, walking to Lugdana's Knoll, a small, quiet hill to the north of Barovia. (The hill is named for the paladin Lugdana, who, according to legend, first met Burgomaster Ismark Antonovich the Great upon that hill.)

Shortly before noon, if the players haven't been keeping track of her, [[Non-Player Characters#Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]—who's currently debriefing a pair of Barovian **scouts** regarding their unsuccessful search for Gertruda—notes Ireena's absence with minor concern and asks the players to find her and bring her home. 

Because Strahd and his servants have only visited at night, Ismark isn't notably alarmed by Ireena's absence, but still wants to see her brought home as quickly as reasonably possible. Ismark advises that the players check Lugdana's Knoll first—one of Ireena's favorite spots around the village—and provides brief directions to get there. 

If the players visit the knoll, read:

<div class="description">
<p>As you pass through the sea of tall grasses north of the village, a gentle knoll rises before you, bordered on the far side by the clutches of the dark Svalich Wood. Plants with white, feathery flowers and a sweet, earthy scent seem to dance amidst the grass atop the hill, their leaves rustling in a whispering wind.</p>
<p>A lonely tree stands atop the hill, its gnarled branches reaching skyward like outstretched arms. Beneath its shade kneels a female figure, her gaze fixated upon the ground.</p>
</div>

The figure is Ireena, who has donned her chestplate and rapier and now wears a red scarf around her neck. As the players approach, they can see that she is using a trowel to dig a hole in the earth between the tree's roots. Ireena, fixated upon her work, doesn't notice the players until they call out to her or otherwise enter her field of view.

Ireena greets the players with warmth, though with some embarrassment for having driven them to come search for her. She shares freely that she is digging for a small wooden chest that she and her mother, Korina Targolova, buried here before her mother's death fourteen years ago—a coffer whose contents she hopes to take as a keepsake when she departs for Vallaki, given that she doesn't know when, if ever, she'll be able to return home.

If allowed to finish unearthing the chest, Ireena opens it, revealing its contents. The chest contains a silver bracelet set with gemstones, a pressed aster flower, a wooden charm in the shape of the yarrow flower on a leather cord, and a handkerchief with floral patterns.

The flower (which Ireena found and her mother pressed), charm (which Ireena's mother wore as an apprentice to the town's healer), and handkerchief (which Ireena's mother helped her to sew) are all mementos of Ireena's childhood with her mother. The bracelet is an item that Ireena was found carrying when Kolyan found her in the Svalich Wood, which Korina kept as a memento of their "miracle child" after she learned that she could bear no more children.

The bracelet holds no sentimental value for Ireena, and she doesn't remember why she was carrying it when Kolyan first found her, or where she obtained it. She offers it to the players as a gift for their agreement to escort her to Vallaki, as compensation for their trouble.

The silver bracelet, which is tarnished and clearly hundreds of years old, is worth 100 gp and bears an intricate pattern of the moon and stars along the exterior, with a moonstone gem embedded at the center of the moon and five lapis-lazuli serving as the stars. On the inside of the bracelet, in tiny, elegant script, the following message is engraved in Common: "Tatyana: May you find your path, and may you find light even in the darkest places—Mother & Father."

Ireena doesn't know who Tatyana is. (Unbeknownst to Ireena, the bracelet was a gift from Tatyana Federovna's parents on Tatyana's eighteenth birthday. It was lost in the Svalich Wood when Tatyana leapt to her death from the Castle Ravenloft overlook.)

After sharing the items in the chest, Ireena removes her scarf, revealing the bite marks on her neck. As she traces her fingers along them, she grimaces. "I don't know why he hasn't killed me or turned me," she says, gritting her teeth as her hands curl into fists. "I don't know if this is some kind of sick game he's playing, or if he just likes to see people suffer."

The anger leaves her as she adds, her voice tightening, "They say women with red hair bring bad luck. I'm sorry—I never wanted to bring any to you." (She is grateful for any reassurances the players might offer.)

Ireena gladly returns to the mansion with the players, or returns on her own shortly after noon if the players failed to find her. She then retrieves a packed traveling bag from her room.

When the players are ready to leave, Ireena bids Ismark a heartfelt farewell and sets off on the road.

**_Milestone_**. Defending the village and burying the Burgomaster completes a story milestone. If the players depart Barovia with Ireena accompanying them, award each player 400 XP. If Doru successfully passed his test of will, award each player an additional 100 XP.

## B5k. Mad Mary’s Townhouse

There should be no reason for the players to visit <span class="citation">Mad Mary’s Townhouse (p. 44)</span> in this revision. However, if they do, the following changes have been made:

Mad Mary did not hide Gertruda in this house for her entire life. Instead, Gertruda lived a fairly ordinary life—albeit one with a fairly overbearing widowed mother. (Ireena and Gertruda initially bonded as young girls over the loss of their parents—Ireena's mother and Gertruda's father.) When he was alive, Gertruda’s father was a merchant who raised Gertruda on stories of great lords and ladies, using their family’s meager funds to purchase her occasional books from Vistani caravans regarding diplomacy and military history.

The first floor of this old, dirty dwelling comprises a one-room divided living space. To the north lies a small kitchen, its countertops dirty and covered with dust. There is a broken glass on the floor and a rotted meal for two set on a table covered with a dirty blue tablecloth. (Mary poured herself a glass of wine to steady her nerves after realizing Gertruda's disappearance, and dropped it on the floor in anguish.)

A small sitting area to the south contains a fireplace, two comfortable armchairs, and a dirty rug. Stairs lead up from here to the second floor.

The second floor corridor contains three wooden doors. One leads to a bathroom with an unemptied chamber pot and a bowl of dirty bathwater. Another leads to Mary’s bedroom, which holds a writing desk and a bed. (If found here, Mary is sitting on the bed, quietly sobbing.) 

The third door, which is slightly ajar, leads to Gertruda’s bedroom; a tray holding a broken tea kettle and cup has shattered on the floor before it. (Mary was bringing Gertruda tea when she found her daughter missing, and dropped it in horror.)

Gertruda's room holds a clumsily handwoven dress and a shelf holding a dozen well-read, dog-eared books, as well as a hairbrush, a rug, and an open window.
