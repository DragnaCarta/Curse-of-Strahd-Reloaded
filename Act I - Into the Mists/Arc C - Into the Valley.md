*An adventure for five 3rd-level characters.*

In this arc, the players depart the village of Barovia for Tser Pool and the town of Vallaki. As they journey through the woods, they can encounter a pair of Barovian **scouts** searching for a missing family, distract or do battle with a horde of **zombies**, and recover a weapons cache left by Dr. Rudolph van Richten.

Upon their arrival at the River Ivlis Crossroads, the players encounter Strahd von Zarovich for the first time, accompanied by Escher, one of his vampiric consorts. After a tense conversation, the players can head north to Tser Pool. 

On the way to Tser Pool, the players encounter a raven—the disguised **wereraven** Muriel Vinshaw—fleeing a monstrous **strix**, a scarecrow of the skies crafted by the swamp-witch Baba Lysaga. If the players defend Muriel from the strix’s onslaught, she joins them for the remainder of their journey to Vallaki, though without revealing her true identity.

Soon afterward, the players finally arrive at the Vistani encampment at Tser Pool. There, they receive a magical Tarokka reading from Madam Eva, which foretells the location of three artifacts that will assist them in the fight against Strahd, as well as an ally who is destined to aid them. 

While staying at Tser Pool, the players hear Vistani tales of Strahd's history and the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind*, and can also meet Arturi Radanavich, a wandering Vistana who claims to have once known Rudolph van Richten. As the players depart, they also receive a mission from Madam Eva to purchase a toy in Vallaki for delivery to her great-grand-niece, Arabelle.

If the players are tasked with escorting Ireena to St. Andral's Church in Vallaki, or if they have their own reasons for doing so, they then return to the Old Svalich Road via the River Ivlis Crossroads, traveling west through the mountains. Along the way, they encounter a strange skeletal rider, a pair of fresh graves, a watchful revenant, the **night hag** Morgantha in her peddler's disguise, two flocks of friendly **ravens**, and a **werewolf** accompanied by its pack of ravenous **wolves**. 

Upon arriving in Vallaki, the players can find lodgings at the Blue Water Inn. There, they can meet a host of colorful characters, including the ringmaster Rictavio and the sons of Lady Fiona Wachter. When morning comes, the players can also have a fateful encounter with Baron Vargas Vallakovich and his brutish enforcer, Izek Strazni...

> [!warning]+ **The Road From Tser Pool**
>
> The module’s map of Barovia depicts a dotted line that appears to connect the Tser Pool Encampment to Tser Falls. Despite its appearance, <span class="citation">Tser Falls (p. 37)</span> makes clear that this is not a shortcut. Instead, this dotted line is a footpath that leads to the base of Tser Falls, one thousand feet below the bridge overhead. At no point does it actually reconnect to the main road.

# C1. The Svalich Woods
The journey from the village of Barovia to the River Ivlis Crossroads is three miles long and takes one hour.
## C1a. The Barovian Scouts
As the players travel, read:

<div class="description"><p>You set off from the silent village of Barovia, the fog creeping around your feet as you pass onto the Old Svalich Road. A sea of tall, pale-green grasses stretches out before you on either side of the road, all the way up to the edge of the Ivlis River. The sky above is a dull grey, the clouds heavy with the promise of rain.</p>
<p>It's not long before you can see the old arched stone bridge in the distance that spans the clear blue river ahead. Crossing it, you find yourselves on a muddy road that winds its way through the trees. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and the trees press in close, casting deep shadows that carve dark gouges across the road.</p></div>

If any players have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher, they hear a rustling noise and see a silhouette crouching in the misty underbrush. Otherwise, the players simply hear a voice call out, muffled and diffuse in the fog: “Who goes there? Name yourselves.”

The voice belongs to a gruff female Barovian **scout** named Kereza, who is joined by a second, soft-spoken male **scout** named Korga, whom the players previously encountered in [[Act I - Into the Mists/Arc B - Welcome to Barovia|Arc B - Welcome to Barovia]]. After confirming that the players are not transporting Ireena against her will, the scouts warn the players that Strahd’s spies are numerous throughout the Svalich Woods, including wolves, bats, and—at times—the very trees themselves. (If asked about the trees, the scouts can describe seeing animate vines, saplings, and bramble-patches that wander through the woods with hostile intent.)

If [[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is with the players, she can aid the players in reassuring the scouts, who recognize her and greet her with quiet respect. The scouts are surprised to see Ireena venturing forth from the village, but agree that Vallaki is likely a safer place than Barovia—assuming, of course, that she can make it there safely. (Ireena stubbornly insists, however, that her journey is a diplomatic and humanitarian one, and that the players are her escorts and bodyguards.)

The scouts are searching for the Lansten family: two parents and three young children—a girl and two boys—who went missing during the zombie attack on the village and haven’t been seen since. After asking whether the players have seen their quarries on their journey, the scouts warn them not to stray from the road, noting that dead and dark things lurk beneath the treetops. Kereza and Korga then respectfully depart.

Shortly after the players resume their trek down the Old Svalich Road, a light drizzle begins to fall, stirring a fine mist that drifts through the underbrush.
## C1b. Van Richten’s Cache
As the players continue down the road, read:

<div class="description"><p>You travel further into the woods, the muddy road guiding you deeper and further away from civilization. As the road bends, the river brushes up against you once more. Here, the river is wider, its waters dark and calm. You can see the reflection of the trees and fog in its surface. The sound of the quiet, trickling water is met only by the rustling of leaves and the drizzle of soft rain. No birdsong breaks the silence that hangs over the woods.</p></div>

While traversing this section of the Old Svalich Road, the players are stalked by one of Strahd's spies: a **wolf.** (See <span class="citation">Strahd's Spies, pg. 29</span> for more information.)

If the players received the location of Van Richten’s hidden weapons cache from Doru in Barovia’s church, they can enter the woods to the south to find it. If they do, read:

<div class="description">
<p>You step from the road and into the woods, crossing the treeline as your feet squelch into mud and loamy soil. Wisps of fog curl across the earth around you, gnarled trees reaching their arms overhead as gray light filters through the canopy. You walk for three hundred paces, stepping softly through the mulch and mist until you arrive at a clearing, the woods parting to make room for a tall, ancient oak whose knotted black trunk rises far above its peers.</p>
<p>You soon realize, however, that you’re not alone. Five figures shamble or stand aimlessly within the clearing, their clothes muddied and torn and their flesh just beginning to turn pallid and gray. </p>
</div>

The five figures are **zombies**. They also match the descriptions of the Lansten family provided by the scouts—two parents, a young girl, and two young boys.

The players can attempt to lure the zombies away from the clearing; given the zombies’ low intelligence, doing so should be reasonably easy. Alternatively, the players can attempt to ambush and attack the zombies to destroy them altogether.

If the players reach the oak tree, they can find Van Richten’s weapons cache where Doru told them: in a hollow nestled beneath the tree’s roots. The cache itself is a small, unlocked wooden chest containing 20 silvered crossbow bolts, a light crossbow, two *healer’s kits*, two vials of *holy water*, and one *potion of healing.*
# C2. River Ivlis Crossroads
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 2: Area F.</em></span>

As the players approach this area, the drizzling rain stops. Read:

<div class="description"><p>Soon, the river bends once more out of sight and the dark woods surround the road once again. Finally, though, the trees pull away, revealing a tall cliff at the base of a foggy mountain slope. The air is cold and damp here, and soft wisps of fog swirl around the base of the cliff.</p></div>

The players have arrived at the River Ivlis Crossroads, which is largely as described in <span class="citation">River Ivlis Crossroads (p. 35)</span>. Do not check for a random encounter when the players arrive.

This scene begins similarly to <span class="citation">River Ivlis Crossroads (p. 35)</span>. However, the first time the players move to depart for Tser Pool, instead of seeing **The Hanged One**, they can hear the sound of a horse-drawn carriage or wagon approaching through the fog. Almost as soon as the sound appears, Strahd’s black carriage, as described in <span class="citation">Black Carriage (p. 37)</span> and <span class="citation">Carriage House (p. 54)</span>, comes into view.
## C2a. Strahd’s Arrival
The players can see a driver sitting in the coach box: the **vampire spawn** Escher, as described in <span class="citation">K49. Lounge (p. 70)</span>. If present, Ireena gasps at the sight of him, whispering that she thought that he was dead.

> [!abstract]+ **What If The Players Flee?**
>
> The players should have little time to attempt to conceal themselves before Strahd’s carriage comes into view. However, if the players attempt to flee the carriage into the woods, Strahd’s **dire wolves**—one for each player plus Ireena—emerge from the fog behind them and snarl, obstructing the players' escape.

The carriage then comes to a stop. Read the following, modifying the text as necessary if Ireena isn’t present, and pausing briefly after each paragraph to allow the players a short opportunity to act or react:

<div class="description"><p>The driver releases the reins, steps down from the coach box, and moves to open the side door of the carriage, bowing deeply. A moment passes—and then a man steps out from the carriage.</p>
<p>He is tall, gaunt, and dressed in finery befitting a man of aristocratic, even royal stature. A black cloak is pulled neatly around his shoulders, tied at the neck by a blood-red brooch. A longsword rests ensheathed at his hip, its polished hilt gleaming beneath the dim light. His scarlet tunic is worked with intricate designs, and his hair is pulled back into a sharp and immaculate widow's peak. </p><p>His eyes are dark, and as he moves to adjust the ruby at his neck, you see that his fingernails form long, elegant claws. It's only then that you realize that his skin is pale—unnaturally so— and that his eyes glint with a deep, intelligent hunger.</p></div>

If [[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is with the party, add:

<div class="description"><p>Ireena rocks backward, as if slapped. She averts her eyes from the man's gaze, her entire body tightening. "Don't look into his eyes," she chokes out.</p>
<p>The man's gaze rests briefly on Ireena, and he smiles—though no warmth reaches his eyes. "Lady Kolyana," he says. "What a pleasant surprise." He then turns his gaze to you. </p></div>

Whether Ireena is with the party or not, add:

<div class="description"><p>"Good day," he says. "I am Count Strahd von Zarovich—and it is a pleasure to finally meet the newcomers to my domain. My friends have told me so much about you." His eyes linger over each one of you in turn, regarding you like a cut of meat weighed at market, an intriguing but inanimate trinket—a prey animal spotted by a predator in the bush.</p></div>

> [!lore]+ **Strahd’s Foretelling**
>
> At the time that he encounters the players, Strahd is returning from a visit to Madam Eva’s tent at the Tser Pool Encampment. Finding the Forest Fane’s power difficult to control due to Baba Zelenna’s interference during his slumber, he sought Madam Eva’s counsel in his preparations for the Grand Conjunction. He received the following fortune:
>
> - "The Darklord—the master of shadows, the beast in the labyrinth that tears at his chains."
> - "The Six of Stars, the Evoker—the power you covet, a force untamed by mortal hands, raw and wild with burning fury."
> - "The Artifact—the token you seek, the key to power. Divinity’s heart waits, but where?"
> - "The Innocent. I see a maid of raven hair and twilit eyes. She is one way to the token."
> - "But there is another—the Broken One. The path of sacrifice opens another door. The wall that whispers awaits your tribute."
> - "The threads of fate yet spin. The Seven of Swords, the Hooded One, is next. Strangers walk the land—their presence a riddle, their intentions a maze. They dwell in the dusk, their role yet unclear."
> - "But the One of Stars, the Transmuter, is last. Change comes on newcomers’ wings, the dusk of an era upon us. As one age ends, another is born."
>
> Much of Strahd’s foretelling was overheard by Muriel Vinshaw, an eavesdropping **wereraven**, until Strahd detected her presence and drove her away. Both Muriel and Strahd were unaware that Madam Eva knew of Muriel’s presence all along. As the hidden avatar of the Seeker, Eva bears a special bond with Barovia’s wereravens, and deliberately continued her foretelling to allow Muriel to hear it.
>
> Muriel heard the first five cards that Madam Eva read, but doesn’t know the last two. More information about Muriel and her escape from Strahd’s minions can be found in [[#C3. The Strix]] below.

>[!profile]+ **How to Enjoy Roleplaying Strahd**
>Strahd can be a challenging and anxiety-inducing villain to roleplay. To enjoy the experience, rather than dreading it, consider the following tips:
>
>* **Enjoy Invincibility.** Strahd is the one NPC in the entire campaign that (until they obtain the *Sunsword*) your players cannot hurt in any meaningful way. Their strongest attacks do little more than tickle him. Their cruelest insults merely amuse him. Enter Strahd-related scenes without fear of player action.
>* **Embrace Unpredictability.** In each scene before [[Arc R - The Tyrant's Trials]], Strahd has no particular goal, and won't be disappointed if events unfold differently than he expected. Release any obligation you feel to make the scene conclude in a particular way.
>* **Explore Darkness.** Strahd provides a risk-free opportunity to explore and relish darker emotions, such as (justified) arrogance, (quiet) cruelty, and (subtle) contempt. Savor those emotions and the impact they have on your players.

> [!abstract]+ **The Players Misbehave**
>
>  If a player acts rudely toward Strahd, he sighs and replies, "Disrespect is unbecoming, especially in the face of the Lord of the land you are but a guest in. But you are foreign, and untaught, and confused. I'll give you a warning, this time. But I fear my mercy will not last forever."
>  
>  The first time a player disrespects Strahd after receiving his warning, he smiles, holds up a single finger, and says, "One." Strahd's dire wolves, if they have not already emerged, step forth from the shadows and fixate their gazes on the rude player. 
>  
>  The second time that a player disrespects Strahd, he shakes his head, holds up two fingers, and says, "Two." Strahd's dire wolves step closer to the rude player and begin salivating.
>  
>  The third time that a player disrespects Strahd, he frowns. Read the following:
>  
>  <hr>
>  
> "You seem to be under the misunderstanding that you are special," Strahd says. "You are not. You are an outsider to my lands, with nary an ounce of respect or common wit. It amuses me, from time to time, to take the measure of those who enter the valley from beyond the Mists."
> 
> His eyes narrow. "But you have taken your own measure, and I have found it wanting. You are not brave. You are not cunning. You invite death, and I have never been one to deny my subjects such a wish, no matter how foolish. This final chance, I shall grant you, to save your own life—for I see no value in it above that of the lowliest creature that crawls in the muck." 
> 
> He holds up a third finger. "The next time you speak, my pets will kill you. Any who defend you will share the same fate."
> 
> <hr>
> 
> If the player violates Strahd's ultimatum, pause the game and address the player out-of-character. Note that Strahd has promised clear consequences, and that the player's actions will invoke those consequences. Make clear that the player's character will die; that the player will not have a chance to prevent it; that any characters who attempt to protect that player will also die; that any characters who die will not be resurrected; and that if the entire party dies, the campaign will immediately end. 
> 
> If the players confirms their decision, resume the game. Strahd's dire wolves then attack that player. If any or all of the other players do not interfere, Strahd continues his conversation with them, undisturbed.

> [!abstract]+ **Running Away**
> If, at any point during the encounter, the players move to flee, read:
> 
> <hr>
> 
> From behind Strahd, you hear a chorus of low, feral growls. Multiple pairs of eyes glint from the underbrush—each one the height of a man's shoulder.
> 
> Slowly, from the shadows, slinks a pack of massive wolves, each one as tall as a horse and twice as muscled, measuring nine feet in length from head to haunches. Their fur is a thick, mottled grey, and saliva drips from their yellowed, sharpened teeth.
> 
> They take up positions behind and around Strahd, flanking him like a noble's honor guard.
> 
> "You must forgive my pets," Strahd says. "They can be . . . **overenthusiastic** at the sight of new friends."
> 
> <hr>
> 
> The wolves are **dire wolves**, as described in <span class="citation">Dire Wolves (p. 30)</span>. (The number of dire wolves in the pack is equal to the number of players in the party.)
> 
> If the players appear to need further persuading, the dire wolves step forward, growling with their hackles raised. If the players proceed to flee, the wolves attack.

> [!abstract]+ **Challenging Strahd**
> If, at any point during the encounter, a player challenges Strahd or insists that he must be defeated, Strahd smiles, admits he's "never been one to decline a challenge," and invites the player to defeat him—right here, right now—if they can. He promises to make no effort to stop them for the first thirty seconds of their assault.
> 
> If the player declines, Strahd dismisses them as a coward, noting with disappointment, "A pity. I had hoped for better." If the player accepts, Strahd allows them to attack him for five full rounds. During this time, each attack the player makes against Strahd automatically hits, and Strahd automatically fails all Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
> 
> When the five rounds have elapsed, Strahd says, "Impressive determination—if ultimately futile." He adds, "Now, let us see how you fare when the true game begins." 
> 
> Assuming his [[Strahd von Zarovich#The Mage|Mage]] form, Strahd casts ***telekinetic grasp*** each round to suspend the player in the air above him, and casts ***blindness/deafness*** as a reaction whenever the player makes a melee attack against him. The first time the player fails their saving throw against ***telekinetic grasp***, he says, "Escape if you can." He then adds, in a lower tone: "But should you find yourself lacking, a simple plea for mercy will release you from your plight."
> 
> The first time the player succeeds their saving throw against ***telekinetic grasp***, Strahd applauds their tenacity, then asks whether they shall choose to continue to fight. (If they do, he continues to fight using his full Mage statblock.)
> 
> If the player asks to be freed from Strahd's ***telekinetic grasp***, he does so without delay. "Wisdom lies in recognizing one's limitations," he notes. "Remember this moment—for the next time, I may not be as generous."
> 
> If the player is knocked unconscious by Strahd's ***telekinetic grasp***, he crouches beside them, whispering: "You fought bravely, but even the greatest warrior cannot outlast the inevitable. Rest now, comforted by the knowledge that you have entertained me." He then turns to the remainder of the party and invites them to care for their wounded companion.
## C2b. The Conversation Begins
If undiverted, [[Strahd von Zarovich#The Gentleman|Strahd]] greets each of the player characters individually—by name, if his spies have had a chance to learn them and report back to him. While doing so, he makes a personal comment regarding each character’s species, class (if apparent from their equipment or dress), and/or personality (if reported by his spies). If possible, he frames each comment in the form of a compliment, sympathetic remark, or (sparingly) exceptionally veiled threat.

If [[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is present, Strahd then asks if “Lady Kolyana” has properly introduced them to his domain, and apologizes for any “folktales” his subjects may have shared about him. 

(He does not, however, deny his attack on the village of Barovia, noting only that the people of the village defied him in an act of utmost treason. "I am sure that you can agree that my response was a measured one," he says. "After all, no lord could tolerate a settlement that fostered such sedition. The good people of Barovia needed to be taught a lesson. Their discipline was a kindness that few others would entertain.")

As the conversation progresses, Strahd notes that he's heard "such wonderful things" of the players' exploits at "a certain old house at the edge of my domain." Strahd then makes brief reference to the players' actions in Death House, sardonically lauding their "fierce and fiery valor."

If the players ask about the nature of Death House, or its purpose in bringing them to Barovia, Strahd smiles coldly and says only, "The souls of the damned are tragically twisted things. Do not linger upon their madness."

If the players ask about Strahd's driver, Strahd introduces him as Escher, "my coachman and cupbearer." Escher does not respond to the players’ questions or statements and simply stands demurely at Strahd’s side.

> [!abstract]+ **Requesting Freedom**
> If the players ask whether Strahd has intentionally trapped them in Barovia, he truthfully denies doing so. If asked to release them, however, he declines to do so. "Why should I release you," he says, with a wry smile, "when it amuses me to do otherwise?"
## C2c. Strahd's Questions
During the conversation, at moments when it seems natural to do so, [[Strahd von Zarovich#The Gentleman|Strahd]] poses the players the following questions (in no particular order):

* "Ismark Kolyanovich defied me by obstructing the justice I meted out unto his village. Why should I, as his lord, not punish him for his disloyalty?"
* "I have claimed Ireena Kolyana, and marked her as my own. Why should I not take her with me to Castle Ravenloft right now?"
* "You are trespassers in my lands, and the last outsider that entered Barovia fostered sedition and treachery. Why should I not dispatch you now, just as I disposed of him?" (Strahd's question is referring to Dr. Rudolph van Richten.)

If the players buried Walter's bones and put the spirits of Death House to rest, Strahd poses an additional question:

* "Immediately prior to your entry to my lands, you caused great damage to a group of my servants—the occupants of a particular house on the borders of my domain. I had relied upon those servants to bring me specimens of interest, but your activities have left them indefinitely indisposed. Why should I not punish you for your crimes against them?"

Strahd frames each of these questions as a hypothetical. In asking them, his tone is inquisitive, curious, and at least somewhat amused. If the players despair at the prospect of answering these questions at all, Strahd notes, "I am not an unreasonable man. If there is some reason or rationale that I might have missed, then by all means do enlighten me."
## C2d. Strahd's Concessions
As the players attempt to answer his questions, [[Strahd von Zarovich#The Gentleman|Strahd]] delights in playing Devil's advocate, pushing back against their responses and probing at the holes in their reasoning. Ultimately, though, if the players' points are at least reasonably well-argued, Strahd is willing to accept them. (It should be fairly clear to the players, however, that he is merely humoring them by accepting their responses.)

The players can push Strahd to make the following concessions:

* He agrees to overlook Ismark's transgressions, so long as Ismark does not defy him or act counter to his will again.
* He agrees to allow Ireena to depart the River Ivlis Crossroads safely. (Strahd will not grant a longer grace period than that.) 
* He agrees to refrain from judgment against the players unless they take action directly against his person.
* He agrees to forgive the players their transgressions against the cult of Death House.

The players might successfully exact these concessions using a variety of arguments, including (but not limited to) the following:

* The players have promised Ismark that they will escort Ireena to Vallaki and they must be allowed to fulfill their word.
* The players have taken no hostile action against Strahd and should be granted a presumption of innocence.
* The players' actions in Death House were conducted in self-defense, and therefore should be excused. 

If the players appear to doubt Strahd's fidelity to his concessions, [he promises](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/e99hko/an_anthology_of_strahds_taunts_and_quips/), "Fear not, dear children. I am no liar. We both know deception is for the weak."

When the players have answered all of Strahd's questions to his satisfaction, he bids them farewell and steps back into the black carriage.

As he does, Strahd’s **dire wolves**—including one for each player plus Ireena—emerge from the woods, if they haven’t already, and move to flank the carriage. Strahd notes that he and his “friends” shall see the players again—perhaps very soon. The carriage and the wolves then depart for Castle Ravenloft.
## C2e. Departing the Crossroads
As the players move to depart the River Ivlis Crossroads after Strahd has left, they encounter <span class="citation">The Hanged One (p. 35)</span>. The character hanged from the gallows should be the character who was the rudest to Strahd or the least cooperative with his questions.
# C3. The Strix
Halfway down the path from the River Ivlis Crossroads to Tser Pool Encampment, the players hear the sound of a distressed bird cawing from above. A raven with blue-tipped wings—recognizably the same raven that met them in the village of Barovia—then crashes into the road at the players’ feet, visibly wounded. This is, again, the **wereraven** Muriel, in disguise with 1 hit point. Her wings and torso have been penetrated by several dozen silver barbs, leaving her unable to fly, regenerate, or transform until removed.

The raven’s arrival is followed soon after by a terrible, grating shriek and the arrival of a **greater strix**: a large artificial “bird” crafted of wood, animal skins, burlap, and hundreds of black raven’s feathers. 

The **greater strix** uses the statistics of a **manticore**, but is Medium and has vulnerability to fire damage. Instead of actual tail spikes, the greater strix’s **_tail spikes_** attack releases a volley of dozens of tiny silver barbs from its wings.

![[Greater Strix.png]]
<span class="credit">"Greater Strix" by Caleb Cleveland. Support him on <a href="https://patreon.com/calebisdrawing/">Patreon!</a></span>

The greater strix is joined by two **swarms of lesser strix** (each using the statistics of a **swarm of ravens**). Each lesser strix is an artificial “crow” slightly larger than a raven, crafted of burlap, straw, twigs, and sharp stone teeth.

> [!combat]- **Balancing the Strix**
> This combat encounter is a **bruising** encounter against a party of five 3rd-level players and a CR 1 ally (Ireena Kolyana), and will consume approximately 34% of their total maximum hit points. For parties of smaller or larger sizes, modify the encounter as follows:
> 
> * ***Three Players.*** Reduce the greater strix’s hit points to 46. Reduce its ***tail spike*** and ***bite*** attacks to 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage and its ***claw*** attack to 4 (1d4+2) slashing damage. Reduce the number of swarms of lesser strix to one and reduce the swarm's hit points to 16 and its ***bite*** attack to 5 (2d4) piercing damage or 2 (2d4) piercing damage if it has half its hit points remaining or fewer.
> * ***Four Players.*** Reduce the number of swarms of lesser strix to one.
> * ***Six Players.*** Increase the number of swarms of lesser strix to three.

These abominations were built by the witch Baba Lysaga to hunt down wereravens. These particular strix—a gift from Baba Lysaga to Strahd upon his awakening—have been ordered to hunt and kill Muriel, who was spotted eavesdropping on the Tarokka reading that Strahd received from Madam Eva earlier that morning. It continues to pursue Muriel, attacking the players instead if they attempt to harm it or otherwise shelter Muriel from its assault. It fights to the death.

> [!warning]+ **Don't Hurt Ireena**
> Strahd's minions and those loyal to him, including the strix, don't attack Ireena.

If rescued, Muriel remains with the players until she can discern their intent. A player can remove the silver barbs in her body and wings with a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, reducing her to 0 hit points and causing her to fall unconscious on a failure. Once the barbs are removed, however, Muriel’s regeneration immediately returns, healing her wounds in a matter of seconds.

<p><strong><em>Mimic.</em></strong> Muriel can mimic simple sounds she has heard, such as a person whispering, a baby crying, or an animal chittering. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Plummet.</em></strong> If Muriel flies at least 20 feet straight toward a target while descending at least five feet toward the ground, and then hits that target with a shortsword attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p> 
<h3>Actions</h3> 
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Muriel makes two weapon attacks, one of which can be with her hand crossbow.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Shortsword.</em></strong> (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only) <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Hand Crossbow.</em></strong> (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only) <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beak.</em></strong> (Raven or Hybrid Form Only) <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 1 piercing damage in raven form, or 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage in hybrid form. If the target is humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with wereraven lycanthropy.</p> 
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3> 
<p><strong><em>Shapechange.</em></strong> Muriel polymorphs into a raven-humanoid hybrid or into a raven, or back into her human form. Her statistics, other than her size, are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her human form if she dies.</p> 
<h3>Reactions</h3> 
<p><strong><em>Interpose.</em></strong> When a creature Muriel can see hits another target within 5 feet of Muriel with an attack, she can use her reaction to take the damage instead.</p>
</div>

If she learns that the players plan to travel to Vallaki, Muriel travels with them while maintaining her raven disguise, hoping to rely upon safety in numbers until she can report her findings to Urwin Martikov at the Blue Water Inn. Under no conditions does Muriel willingly reveal her true nature to the players at this time.

> [!info]+ **Muriel Incognito**
> While traveling with the players, Muriel tries to keep a low profile while ingratiating herself with the group. While she is in raven form, the players can communicate with her only using the *speak with animals* spell, though she denies all knowledge of Strahd or the strix's origins and pretends to be an ordinary, simple-minded raven concerned only with food and avoiding predators. If asked for her name, she insists excitedly, then (if questioned) stubbornly, that her name is "Blue."
> 
> While accompanying the group, Muriel may use her ***mimicry*** feature to produce any of the following sounds to prompt or react to the players:
> 
> * **Whistle.** To signal secrecy or caution.
> * **Snoring.** To signal boredom.
> * **Laughter.** To signal amusement.
> * **Jingling.**  To indicate someone's arrival.
> * **Clicking (like a key turning).** To applaud a solution to a problem.
> * **Trumpet.** To celebrate a victory or achievement.

# C4. Tser Pool
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 2: Area G.</em></span>

The journey from the River Ivlis Crossroads to the Tser Pool Encampment is one-and-a-half miles long and takes thirty minutes.

> [!warning]+ **New Content Warning**
> In the v2.0.8 update, added **July 18, 2024**, Madam Eva's invitation in [[Act I - Into the Mists/Arc B - Welcome to Barovia]] was removed. In its place, Ismark Kolyanovich now asks the players to travel to Tser Pool and seek Madam Eva's guidance on how Strahd may be defeated. Dungeon Masters who used the old version of Arc B should instead use the [[Deprecated Material/Arc C - Into the Valley#C4. Tser Pool|deprecated version of this scene]]. (All other scenes in this arc, beginning with [[#C5. The Skeletal Rider]], remain unchanged.)
## C4a. Arrival at Tser Pool
This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">G. Tser Pool Encampment (p. 36)</span>. However, none of the Vistani at the camp are intoxicated, and only one—a Vistana woman named Eliza—serves as a spy for Strahd.

As the players enter the camp, they are met by Stanimir, an old Vistana who informs them that the leader of their encampment, Madam Eva, has been waiting for them and points them toward Eva’s tent. Stanimir, a jovial, colorful old man with a twinkle in his eye is largely as described in <span class="citation">Mysterious Visitors (p. 19)</span>. However, he has the spell *major image* prepared rather than *vampiric touch*.

Stanimir is happy to answer any questions that the players may have about the Vistani or about Barovia, as described in <span class="citation">Vistani Lore (p. 27)</span>. The sole exceptions are the information about soulless Barovians, which don't exist, and Old Bonegrinder, which Stanimir doesn't mention. In addition, Stanimir and the other Vistani don't know that a coven of **night hags** has recently taken up residence in the old windmill, which they know only as the Old Durst Mill. The Vistani also don't mention Vistani curses, which are the stuff of mere superstition, and describe Strahd's interest in Tatyana as "true desire," rather than "true love."

However, Stanimir will not discuss Strahd’s business at Tser Pool. Instead, he shares his belief that Strahd will not soon return, and reassures the players that anything discussed at their meeting with Madam Eva will not reach the vampire’s ears. 

If the players ask whether Strahd obtained a foretelling from Madam Eva, Stanimir tells them that Madam Eva shares her gifts freely with all—but that each person’s future is different, and often difficult to discern.
## C4b. Madam Eva's Tent
This scene unfolds largely as described in <span class="citation">Madam Eva’s Tent (p. 37)</span>. After greeting the players, [[Non-Player Characters#Madam Eva|Madam Eva]] names each player character personally, giving them one or more symbolic epithets related to their histories, their goals, and/or their capabilities.

> [!profile]+ **Profile: Madam Eva**
>
> **Roleplaying Information**
> ***Resonance.*** Madam Eva should inspire discomfort with her intimate knowledge of the players’ pasts, gratitude for her dedication to the players’ journey, and reassurance with her confident predictions.
>
> ***Emotions.*** Madam Eva's most frequent emotions are amusement, solemnity, concern, and contemplation.
>
> ***Motivations.*** Madam Eva wants to see the land of Barovia healed and freed from Strahd's corruption.
>
> ***Inspirations.*** When playing Madam Eva, channel The Ancient One (Doctor Strange) and the Fates (Hercules).
>
> **Character Information**
>
> ***Persona.*** To the world, Madam Eva appears as a wise, yet maddened crone who speaks in prophecies and riddles. To those she trusts, she appears as a kind, yet frustratingly opaque and stubborn old woman.
>
> ***Morale.*** In a fight, Madam Eva would calmly insist that her opponent cease their attacks, then—if her Vistani aides prove unable to stop her assailant—weaken them with the harm spell before demanding their surrender.
>
> ***Relationships.*** Madam Eva alone knows that she is an avatar of the Seeker.

She thanks the players for making the journey to Tser Pool. If asked about Strahd’s visit, she says only that each person’s future is their own to know, and that, while her duty binds her to seek the whispers of Fate for any who invoke her name, she is bound not to reveal what she sees to anyone else.

If Muriel is with the players in raven form, Madam Eva regards her with an emotion nearly resembling fondness and asks to inspect her. She strokes Muriel’s wings and notes that she once had a beloved pet raven named Turul long ago.  

“I have only seen him once these past ten years, however,” Eva adds, somewhat mournfully. “Doubtless, he has gone wild without me.” (Madam Eva is referring to the **Roc of Mount Ghakis**, which served her when she retained the mantle of the Seeker of the Ladies Three.)

If the players ask Eva about [[Act I - Into the Mists/Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B3. Svalich Woods|Dalvan Olensky's corpse]], she shares only that he was a Barovian named Dalvan Olensky who came to her tent in the aftermath of Strahd’s siege on the village of Barovia, and that he insisted upon hearing— and then defying—his fate, a choice with tragic consequences. (As with Strahd, Eva can’t disclose the nature or content of Dalvan’s foretelling.)

If the players ask Madam Eva to read their fortunes, or request her guidance on how to defeat Strahd, her face darkens, and she says, "You stand upon a precipice of a cliff whose base you cannot yet see. Do you understand what you ask of me?"

Regardless of the players' response, Madam Eva replies, shaking her head: "I will not do this thing for you—not yet. If you wish to pursue this path, however, come to the River Ivlis crossroads at midnight tonight. I shall await you there, by the gallows. Come alone—and do not allow yourselves to be followed." Madam Eva refuses to elaborate, and dismisses the players from her tent if they attempt to protest.

As the players prepare to leave, Madam Eva pauses and closes her eyes, though they flash wide open again soon after. Read:

<div class="description"><p>Madam Eva’s voice is a low hiss as she speaks, her silhouette dancing in the flickering candlelight. "A shadow is approaching my tent: a lone servant of Darkness. They seek knowledge of your future—secrets that I am sworn never to reveal to any but their keepers. </p>
<p>“Do not look, child, nor rush to greet them; if they learn of your true aspirations, all may be lost. Do not reveal, even, that you know of their true nature, for their master will know that I have told you, and his wrath will descend upon us all. </p></div>

## C4c. Vistani Hospitality
Upon exiting Madam Eva’s tent, the players find two other Vistani waiting outside of the tent: a woman named Eliza and a man named Arturi Radanavich. Stanimir joins the group a few moments later.

Unless the players intervene, the conversation unfolds as follows:

* Eliza greets the players immediately, giving them a warm welcome to the Tser Pool Encampment. 
* As Stanimir approaches, Eliza clicks her tongue and scolds him for his lack of hospitality, noting that the players seem to have traveled a long way. 
* Stanimir amusedly reminds Eliza that fate waits for no one, but nonetheless invites the players to rest their weary feet at the camp’s central fire, offering wine, food, and song should the players join.
* If the players accept and move to accompany Stanimir, Arturi hesitates, then asks if the players would mind if he accompanied them. He notes that he has heard that they have just arrived from Barovia, and he is curious to hear news from the village. (He adds, somewhat awkwardly, that it has been some time since he had last shared a Vistani fire, and apologizes for imposing upon them and the others.)

> [!profile]+ **Arturi and Eliza**
>
> **Arturi Radanavich**, a cursed Vistana, arrived at the Tser Pool encampment two weeks after Strahd's reawakening. (See **The Curse of Arturi Radanavich** below for more information about Arturi's presence in Barovia and his connection to Dr. Rudolph van Richten.) Arturi is a quiet, soft-spoken man in his late thirties with a distant, almost absent-minded countenance and a near-painful sincerity.
>
> Meanwhile, **Eliza**, one of Strahd’s spies, has heard that outsiders have entered the pool from beyond the Mists, and hopes to glean information about their goals, capabilities, and weaknesses. (Eliza had hoped to eavesdrop on the players’ Tarokka reading as well, but was foiled by Madam Eva’s foresight.)
>
> In sharp contrast to Arturi, Eliza is a cheery, excitable woman in her early thirties, always glad to insert herself into a conversation with a brash or witty comment.

> [!lore]+ **The Curse of Arturi Radanavich**
>
> ***Dark Beginnings.*** Twenty years ago, when Arturi Radanavich was only seventeen, several members of his extended family amongst the Radanavich caravan invited him on a “hunting trip.” Awkward, lonesome, and desperate for connection, Arturi accepted their invitation gratefully.
>
> It wasn’t long, however, before Arturi learned the true nature of their hunt. His aunt, Madame Irene Radanavich and the leader of the caravan, had recently seen her son, Radu, gravely injured. When the Vistani’s treatments proved fruitless, Madame Radanavich had taken Radu to a healer in a nearby village—a doctor named Rudolph van Richten. Radu, however, had died under Van Richten’s care, and a vengeful and grieving Madame Radanavich sought to visit his pain upon Van Richten in turn.
>
> Arturi felt bewildered and afraid—but each time he thought to open his mouth, he imagined the insults and jeers of his cousins or Aunt Irene’s smoldering glare. And so, Arturi watched silently as his family kidnapped Van Richten’s fourteen-year-old son, Erasmus, spirited him away to a darkened mire, and sold him to the vampire lord Baron Metus. The Radanaviches then fled through the Mists—to Barovia.
>
> It wasn’t long after Erasmus was sold that Van Richten tracked the Vistani caravan down, ambushing the d’Avenirs—a Vistani husband and wife who then traveled with the Radanaviches and had aided Madame Radanavich in her vengeance—and demanding to know where his son had been taken. Arturi later learned that Van Richten had spared the d’Avenirs’ lives—a mercy that would not last forever.
>
> Three years later, Van Richten returned, grim-faced and surrounded by a swarm of ravenous undead. His son Erasmus had died—transformed into a vampire spawn and killed by Van Richten’s own hand. Torn by fury and grief, Van Richten released the undead horde upon the Radanavich caravan, howling, “Undead take you as you have taken my son!”
>
> Arturi alone survived, hiding himself away in his grandmother’s magical trunk. When he finally emerged, hours later, he found the encampment shattered, his family slaughtered—and Van Richten nowhere to be found.
>
> ***Arturi's Curse.*** Arturi soon learned, however, that Van Richten’s vengeful words had taken on a life of their own, clinging to him like a burial shroud. “Undead take you,” Van Richten had promised—and so they did, pursuing Arturi wherever he went. The Vistani banished him from their camps after dusk, naming him *mortu*, or “outcast,” a word that can also be more directly translated as “living dead.” No village gave Arturi sanctuary; no town’s walls would protect him.
>
> For eighteen years Arturi evaded his eternal pursuers, even as he desperately searched for a way to escape the clutches of his curse. Finally, shortly after Strahd's reawakening, he returned to Barovia, where he sought the counsel of the Vistana seer Madam Eva. "Find the man who forged your fetters," she told him. "His final breath will set you free."
> 
> Arturi has ranged across Barovia several times since then in search of Van Richten. On one occasion, he even recovered a supply cache, containing a half-written manuscript and a small assortment of weapons. He has been unable, however, to locate the doctor himself.
> 
> Arturi has often returned to Madam Eva's camp to enjoy her hospitality—but stays no longer than dusk each time. For the walking dead never rest, and Arturi dare not lead them to Tser Pool . . . 
>
> **Source:** Wise, David. _Van Richten's Guide to the Vistani._ Wizards of the Coast, 1995.

If the players make their way to the Vistani fire, Eliza—and Arturi, if he is present—introduce themselves. Eliza also asks the players’ names in return. (If asked why he has not shared a Vistani fire until recently, Arturi winces and admits only that the situation is complicated.)
## C4d. The Dancing Fire
As dusk descends around the campfire, the Vistani serve the players a dinner of a hearty stew of rabbit, potatoes, turnips, lentils, and parsnips alongside hearty chunks of flatbread. As they eat, Eliza asks the players about their next destination. If the players note that they are headed toward Vallaki or otherwise indicate an interest in staying the night, Stanimir invites them to rest at the camp overnight, noting that the roads can be long and dangerous beyond Madam Eva’s wagons.

If he hasn’t already, Arturi asks the players for news from Barovia, inquiring specifically whether they have encountered a man named Rudolph van Richten. If asked about his interest, Arturi notes quietly that Van Richten is an acquaintance of his, and that he had recently heard a rumor that he had been seen traveling to Barovia. (This is a lie. A player who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check discerns that Arturi is speaking slightly too quickly. Arturi doesn't reveal the truth if challenged, and instead merely shrugs and says, "Believe what you choose to believe.") Arturi is unsure whether he believes Van Richten to be dead, but suspects that he still lives—if for no other reason than that he has heard the old man is impressively hard to kill.

> [!info]+ **Insight Checks**
> Do not invite players to make Insight checks unprompted. Instead, allow players to ask for information regarding an NPC's body language or truthfulness before inviting them to make one.

After dinner, Stanimir cheerfully informs the players that, as guests at a Vistani fire, they are now expected to play the Game of Stories, and asks whether the players will accept. To play, each participant must put up a wager, which can be an object of small monetary, intellectual, or sentimental value. Each participant must then share a story to make a man “laugh or weep.” Each time a story is told, the other participants in the game must guess whether the story is truth, falsehood, or both. At the end of the game, the participant with the most correct guesses wins the pot.

If the players accept the challenge, Eliza, Arturi, and [[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] also offer to join the game. The participants’ wagers are as follows:

* **Stanimir** wagers a worn deck of Tarokka cards that once belonged to his late wife. (“They’ve sat unused and dusty in my wagon for long enough,” he says with a sad smile. “I think she’d like it if they were out in the world again.”)
* **Eliza** wagers a collapsible brass spyglass with a small, maneuverable mirror, allowing the user to peer around corners.
* **Arturi** wagers a short manuscript on werewolves authored by Dr. Rudolph van Richten.
* **Ireena** wagers a painted wooden hairclip in the shape of a sunflower that she once wore as a child.

Give the players a few minutes away from the table to plan out their stories before the game begins.

> [!lore]+ **Arturi's Manuscript**
>
> Arturi's manuscript—authored by Dr. Rudolph van Richten—is handwritten and two pages long. It is titled "A Study of the Werewolf's Curse," and reads as follows:
>
><hr>
>
> Werewolves are among the most fearsome lycanthropes, bearing a curse as ancient as it is terrifying. For them, the affliction of lycanthropy transforms even the most civilized individual into a monstrous beast, warping the lines betwixt man and nature.
>
> In its humanoid form, a werewolf retains many of the characteristics of its original identity, save for certain nuances such as heightened senses, an explosive temper, and an odd preference for rare meats. Over time, subtle features that hint at their animalistic nature begin to manifest. Nevertheless, it is in their wolf and hybrid forms that the true horror of the curse is revealed. A werewolf's hybrid form is particularly terrifying, with a muscular humanoid body crowned by the head of a ravenous wolf. It is capable of wielding weapons, though its favored means of attack are its devastating claws and powerful bite.
>
> Werewolves typically abandon civilization soon after their transformation. Those who reject the curse flee in fear of harming their loved ones, whereas those who accept it fear exposure and the repercussions of their violent deeds. Out in the wild, they form packs, living in cohesion with ordinary wolves and dire wolves alike.
>
> The most tragic aspect of lycanthropy is its transmission. A humanoid can contract this curse through a wound inflicted by a lycanthrope or through inheritance if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes.
>
> The cursed have two paths: they may resist the beast within or embrace it. Those who resist bear unending strain—until the rising full moon triggers a compulsory and horrific transformation. These individuals often experience bloody, haunting dreams: echoes of the carnage wrought in their madness.
>
> Some twisted souls, however, choose to accept their beastly nature. With time, they can master their abilities, calling upon the wolf's resilience and strength as they will. To do so, however, they must first perform a particular gruesome and foul act—one which I will decline to describe in these pages.
>
> One sure way to identify an afflicted individual is the presence of a perpetually raw, bloody wound: the scar of the initial curse transmission. This wound never fully heals until the curse is lifted.
>
> Beyond this mark, however, these creatures bear an extraordinary resilience. Conventional methods of harm prove ineffective in permanently subduing a werewolf. Only through the bite of silver or the chill of death's power can a werewolf be truly put to rest.
>
> A spell of removal can also cure an afflicted lycanthrope, though those who accept the beast may fight it bitterly. As for those unfortunate souls born under the curse, they are doomed to bear their affliction for life. As far as my research has shown, there exists no cure, no respite for such individuals. They are caught in an eternal struggle, forever haunted by the wolf within.
### Stanimir’s Tale
Stanimir goes first, delivering the same tale as described in <span class="citation">The Dancing Fire (p. 20)</span>. However, exclude the final paragraph, and instead end with the sentence, “The figure in the dancing fire vanquishes its final foe, then disperses in a cloud of smoke and embers.” Throughout his tale, the players can notice Stanimir using the *major image* spell to create the shapes in the flames.

When his tale has ended and all participants have made their guesses—Eliza and Arturi going last, with Eliza voting “True” and Arturi voting “Half-True”—Stanimir reveals that his story was indeed a true tale of the Vistani people, and that the wounded prince lived on as a friend to the Vistani, even when his heart was led astray by shadows and mist. (If asked, Stanimir admits that the prince was Strahd von Zarovich in the days before he came to Barovia, and that his promise to the Vistani is why they remain in the valley to this day, “without fear or favor.”)
### Eliza’s Tale
After one of the players has gone, Eliza then shares the following tale:

<div class="description"><p>“It is said that within each raven flutters a lost soul, and that each raven’s song tells a tale of ages past. They whisper, so listen closely.”</p>
<p>She takes a deep breath; when she speaks again, her voice is quiet, with an eerie, melodic quality to it.</p>
<p>“Sing, ravens, of Barovia, birthed from the mists and bathed in twilight. Sing of Lugdana, the Morninglord’s stalwart, dawn-touched foe to the deep-lurking dark. The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, her radiant testament, the warrior’s beacon of faithful resolve.</p>
<p>“Sing, ravens, of Chernovog’s rise, named Green-God and Demon-Lord upon Yester Hill. Lugdana, gray-haired, weary of battle, her longsword and shield yet polished and ready. Guided through shadows, toward sacred ground, she clashed with the demon, their tempest-like dance.</p>
<p>“Sing, ravens, of Lugdana’s last fury, of Ravenkind’s token now blazing with light. The battle’s tide turning, a hero’s brave cry, a final onslaught with divinity’s grace. The Demon-Lord banished, the warrior now fell, the wound at her side gouged too deep to bear.</p>
<p>“Sing, ravens, of light’s final moments, a shadow descending from radiance on high. Sing of the angel, black-feathered and beaked, the Morninglord’s angel reclaiming its gift. The Symbol retaken, in ravens’ claws held.</p>
<p>“Sing, ravens; you are the keepers, the watchers, the tellers of stories untold. Sing, ravens, of Lugdana’s memory, the shadows that lurk, and heroes to come.”</p></div> 

When her tale has ended and all participants have made their guesses—Stanimir and Arturi going last, with Stanimir voting “True” and Arturi voting “False”—Eliza reveals that her story was half-true. 

Lugdana was indeed a paladin of the Morninglord who bore the legendary *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind*, which was a platinum amulet shaped like a sunburst, with an enormous ruby embedded at its center. According to legend, the symbol was given to Lugdana by an angel in the guise of a raven. Eliza notes with a chuckle, however, that no one knows what happened to the Symbol after Lugdana fell at Yester Hill, nor where it resides today.
### Arturi’s Tale
After three of the players have gone, Arturi then shares the following tale:

<div class="description">
<p>There once was a Fox, renowned for his wisdom and skill, who dwelled with his kit in the misted woods. On a cold, moonlit night, a pair of Sparrows brought him their child, the tendrils of Death clutching its shivering body. The Fox took the chick into his den, but for all his knowledge, he could not cure its ailment, and it breathed its last in his paws.</p>
<p>Driven mad in their grief, the vengeful Sparrows, aided by four of their kin, stole the Fox's kit in the night. They delivered him to the Wolf, who had long hungered for the taste of fox-flesh. The Wolf devoured the kit, and the Sparrows departed to return to their flock.</p>
<p>When the Fox found what the Sparrows had done, rage clutched his own heart. In his cunning, he knew that the Rats, in their burrows beneath the earth, had always despised the songs of the Sparrows far above. The Fox descended to the kingdom of the Rats, and he promised them a forest free of the songs of the Sparrows. Intrigued, the Rats agreed.</p>
<p>The Rats could not find the Sparrows' nest alone. But the crafty Fox could, and as the Sparrows slumbered in the hollow of a great oak, the Rats fell upon them to feast with tooth and claw. For the crimes of six, the flock perished, with nary an egg spared.</p>
<p>The misted wood is darkened, now, and the trees no longer sing with the songs of the Sparrows. But some say that the Rats hunt still—that a lone chick yet escaped their clutches, and that one day, they will find it, and gobble it up like the rest.</p>
</div>

When his tale has ended and all participants have made their guesses—Stanimir and Eliza going last, with Stanimir voting “True” and Eliza voting “False”—Arturi reveals that his story was true. He politely declines, however, to reveal anything further, noting only with a sad smile that "A story cannot truly be told until it has ended."
### Ireena’s Tale
After all of the players have gone, [[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] (if present) then shares the following tale:

<div class="description"><p>"When I was a child, my father took me and my brother to a vast, tranquil lake. I remember the sand beneath my bare feet, and the lapping of the waves against the shore. </p>
<p>"But then, something broke the silence—a low growl that echoed through the wind. As I turned, I saw a beast emerge from the fog: a wolf, far larger than any I'd ever seen. I still remember its eyes—yellow, cold, and hungry.</p>
<p>"My father screamed for me to run. I took off for the woods, and the wolf followed, its snarls echoing through the underbrush. I remember branches whipping against my face, thorns cutting at my feet as my legs burned and my breath grew ragged, but my fear drove me forward.</p>
<p>"It was only much later, when my heart had quieted in my chest and the wolf's footsteps had faded into silence, that I finally allowed myself to stop. By then, though, the woods were strange to me, and my father's shouts had faded. </p>
<p>"A heavy mist had descended around me, and shadowed shapes lurked in every corner. I stepped forward, one hand reaching fearfully into the fog—and a wolf made of mist leapt forth, its jaws opened wide to devour me. And then—everything went black.</p>
<p>"The next thing I remembered, I awoke in my own bed, my father's humming echoing from the kitchen. I don't know how I got there, or what became of the wolf, but I can still remember its teeth as clearly as ever."</p></div>

When her tale has ended and all participants have made their guesses—Stanimir voting “True” and Eliza and Arturi voting “False”—Ireena reveals that her story was false. With a quiet laugh, she shares that the story is a dream that she’s had since childhood, noting that there are no lakes near the village of Barovia and that she’d never seen a **dire wolf** until recently.

If challenged on his vote, Stanimir merely says, with a mysterious smile, that many dreams have a kernel of truth. He then thanks Ireena for sharing her tale.
### Arturi Departs
When the game ends, Arturi bids the players farewell and departs from the camp. If asked why, he shares, with a sad smile, that the camp is in danger each moment he lingers there after dark. "I have been selfish tonight," he murmurs, "and pushed my fortunes as far as I dare. But I dare not remain any longer, for fear of the terror that might follow." 

A player who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check can convince Arturi to share that the undead pursue him wherever he goes, and that they have haunted him each night for the past eighteen years. "A man once vowed that undead shall take me," he says. "And although they have not yet succeeded, they have never failed to try." He declines to explain further, asserting sadly: "Some tales wound the teller. Please, ask no more."

Arturi refuses any offers to defend him, and slips away into the night, eventually settling amidst the boughs of a tall tree two miles from the encampment. The undead then emerge as follows:

* Thirty minutes after Arturi arrives, twelve **zombies** arrive to mill about the base of the tree. 
* Two hours later, five **ghouls** arrive to claw and howl at the trunk of the tree. 
* Two hours later, three **ghasts** arrive to join the ghouls. 
* Two hours later, four **wights** emerge silently to stand guard around the base of the tree.

The undead vanish into the woods shortly before dawn.
## C4e. Return to the River Ivlis Crossroads
The journey from the Tser Pool Encampment to the River Ivlis Crossroads is one-and-a-half miles long and takes thirty minutes. Players who attempt to conceal their movements from Eliza, Strahd's spy in the camp, must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity (Stealth) check or take other covert action to do so.
### Traveling to the Crossroads
As the players make the journey to the crossroads, read:

<div class="description">
<p>A pallid moon hangs low in the sky, casting a weak, silvery glow upon the mist-shrouded landscape below. Ancient trees loom on either side of the muddy road, their gnarled branches reaching out like skeletal fingers.</p>
<p>As the witching hour approaches, an eerie stillness descends. Even the leaves cease their rustling, leaving the squelch of your boots through mud the only lingering sound.</p>
</div>

If the players failed to conceal their departure, any players with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or greater realize they're being followed. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>The sound of a snapping twig cuts through the silence like shattering glass. A bush behind you rustles—then abruptly falls still.</p>
</div>

The rustling bush hides the Vistani **bandit** Eliza. If the players disregard her, she continues to shadow the players as they approach the crossroads. Otherwise, if the players confront her, she reacts as follows:

**If the players call out to Eliza**, she remains hidden and doesn't respond.

**If the players find Eliza's hiding spot**, she steps from the underbrush with her hands raised in a gesture of peace. She reassures the players that she meant them no harm, and insists that she followed them out of curiosity for their night-time travels. "Out and about at midnight—at a time when all but monsters fear to tread?" she breathes, her eyes glinting. "One might think you were *up to* something—and a storyteller can always use more tales." 

Eliza hopes to travel with the players openly to their destination. If refused, she "agrees" to return to Tser Pool, but secretly loops back to follow the players' tracks. If the players attempt to convince her that any such endeavor would be fruitless and succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check, however, Eliza returns to Tser Pool and remains there for the night.

**If the players threaten Eliza**, she immediately surrenders, throwing herself on their mercy. If they succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check, she reveals that she "reports to the lord of the castle." If asked why she serves Strahd, her eyes glint with a hint of fanaticism as she breathlessly avows that Strahd is—or should be—the "king" of the Vistani. "He is the one who brought us home," she whispers reverently. "We delivered him from death, and, in gratitude, he delivered us from exile."

> [!lore]+ **Eliza's Fanaticism**
> Eliza freely admits that few Vistani agree with her beliefs or loyalty to Strahd—a fact that drives her to curse the "ungrateful" and "faithless" among them. Although she doesn't believe Barovia is the ancestral home of the Vistani, Eliza believes it to be a new home that Strahd found for them.

**If the players attack Eliza**, she attempts to flee into the woods. If allowed to do so, Eliza immediately moves to return to Castle Ravenloft, and doesn't return to Tser Pool that night. If the players give chase, run the chase as described in <span class="citation">Chases (<em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>, p. 252)</span>, using the **Wilderness Chase Complications** table as follows:

* Use a **swarm of biting midges** (using the statistics for a **swarm of wasps**) for the **swarm of insects**
* Use a stampede of spooked **elk** for the stampede of spooked animals
* Use a **giant spider** for the creature indigenous to the area

While fleeing through the woods, Eliza has half cover from any player at least 30 feet away, and three-quarters cover from any player at least 60 feet away.

**If the players attempt to conceal their tracks from Eliza**, they can do so by traveling off-road and succeeding on a DC 11 Dexterity (Stealth) check, followed by a DC 11 Wisdom (Survival) check. Players who depart from the road in this way encounter a **will-o'-wisp** as described in <span class="citation">Will-o'-Wisp (p. 33)</span>.
### The March of the Dead
When the players arrive at the River Ivlis Crossroads, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The well-worn path returns to the crossroad, now illuminated beneath the pale, sickly light of the moon. Across the road, the mist-shrouded headstones seem to hunker down in the gloom beside the old wooden gallows, whose frayed rope dangles lifelessly in the still air.</p>
<p>A squat, cloaked silhouette stands beside the gallows—waiting.</p>
</div>

The silhouette is Madam Eva. She does not answer if called out to, and waits for the players to approach her. When they do, she whispers to them, her voice rasping like a chill wind: "*What did I say to you before you departed my tent?*" If the players respond accurately, Madam Eva nods, assured of their identities. 

> [!abstract]+ **Eliza's Flight**
> If the players failed to stop Eliza from following them, Eliza is hiding behind a patch of underbrush to the north of the crossroads, watching them silently. If she is, Madam Eva's eyes flare wide, and she exhales sharply. "Fools!" she breathes. "You were followed—dispatch her, or all is lost!" She then gestures toward Eliza's hiding place. 
> 
> Once noticed, Eliza immediately attempts to flee into the woods, beginning with a 30-foot head start. If allowed to do so, Eliza immediately moves to return to Castle Ravenloft, and doesn't return to Tser Pool that night. If the players give chase, run the chase as described in <span class="citation">Chases (<em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>, p. 252)</span>, using the **Wilderness Chase Complications** table as follows:
> * Use a **swarm of biting midges** (using the statistics for a **swarm of wasps**) for the **swarm of insects**
> * Use a stampede of spooked **elk** for the stampede of spooked animals
> * Use a **giant spider** for the creature indigenous to the area
> 
> While fleeing through the woods, Eliza has half cover from any player at least 30 feet away, and three-quarters cover from any player at least 60 feet away.
> 
> If Eliza is caught, Madam Eva is insistent that she be killed and thrown into the River Ivlis, "lest she report what she has seen and heard to her master." If challenged, Madam Eva coldly replies that "there can be no equivocation when Fate itself balances upon the precipice."

If further questioned, Madam Eva holds up a hand, then silently turns to face the unmarked graveyard near the gallows. The March of the Dead, as described in <span class="citation">March of the Dead (p. 48)</span>, begins shortly thereafter.

Once the March has begun, Madam Eva informs the players: "Each spirit in this march shares a common trait. Can you suppose what that might be?" If the players answer correctly, she then asks, "Where do you suppose they might be headed?"

Regardless of the players' answer, Madam Eva then shares the information about the March provided in <span class="citation">March of the Dead (p. 48)</span>, either in response to the players' questions or of her own initiative once the March has fully departed the graveyard.

"This is the precipice you walk," she warns them once the March has departed. "There are many paths among the webs of Fate, but I can only see what may be—not what will. I can tell you what you *must* do, but I cannot ensure that you will succeed. For if you fail, this shall be your resting place—a place without legacy, glory, or love. Do you understand?"

Regardless of the players' answer, Madam Eva fixates them with a steady gaze. "If you wish to put aside this mission, no soul could blame you. There is no shame in flight from a foe that no others have defeated. If you wish me to read your futures, I can read your palms, or gaze into my crystal ball. I can tell you the face of your true love, the path to good health in your elder years, or the success you might find in a trade of profession." She pauses, then adds, her voice nearly a whisper: "Or I can read the cards—and set you upon a path that ends only when your foe is vanquished—or you are. The choice is yours."

If the players insist upon a desire to defeat Strahd, Madam Eva nods. "Very well," she says. "Then let us begin." 
## C4f. The Tarokka Reading
Madam Eva begins the Tarokka reading by seating herself upon the cemetery earth, reaching into her cloak, and removing three old candles, which she stakes into the ground and lights with a wave of her hand. She then removes a deck of Tarokka cards, which she sets upon the ground between the candles. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>Her old hands working deftly, the ancient seer removes fourteen cards from the top of the deck, setting them aside. The remaining cards, she shuffles nimbly twice, three times, four.</p>
</div>

As she shuffles the deck, the players notice a velvet pouch upon the ground beside her that wasn't present a moment before. Madam Eva meets their eyes, then cackles quietly. "The task you seek of me is no small boon," she murmurs. "In exchange, I would ask a boon of my own."

If the players accept Madam Eva's request or inquire further, she informs them that the pouch contains ten gold pieces. "My great-grand-niece, Arabelle, will celebrate her tenth nameday in two days' time," she says. "For this momentous occasion, I wish to provide her a gift—but in my old age, I am quite unable to make the journey myself."

Madam Eva asks the players to use the funds in the pouch to purchase a toy for Arabelle at Blinsky Toys in Vallaki—Blinsky’s, she notes fondly, are Arabelle’s favorites—and deliver the toy to the Vistani encampment to the southwest of Vallaki by noon on Arabelle’s nameday. She adds that the players are welcome to keep any change as payment for their efforts.

Eva adds, with a cryptic smile, that the players may enjoy speaking with Arabelle, as she is “a most interesting child”—and that the players may find befriending her family a gift in itself. (If the players ask, Eva shares only that Arabelle's father, Luvash, is the leader of the Vallakian Vistani encampment, and his brother Arrigal a "perceptive and intelligent man.")

If the players accept Madam Eva's task, she nods approvingly. She then begins the Tarokka reading. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>Madam Eva sets both decks upon the earth before her. Closing her eyes, she places her right hand over the surface of the larger deck. The crimson flames dim and swirl in eldritch patterns as her lips move silently, a distant tension spreading through the air. The sounds of the rustling trees and rippling pool beyond the tent's walls begin to dim, the external world growing mute and insubstantial as the space within grows more solid—more real.</p>
<p>Slowly, reverently, the crone draws three cards from the top of the deck, laying them face down separately on the ground, with the second laid between and above its partners. She then moves to the smaller deck, drawing two more cards. The first, she places below the first three, forming a cross. The second, she places in the center.</p>
<p>The shadows of the headstones around her sway like silhouettes, leaning in toward the cards like anxious watchers—yet the air in the cemetery is perfectly still. No light intrudes besides the light of the three candles; no voice rings out in the silence. Shadows and mist swirl beyond the graves, where the darkness of deepest night dwells—but here, at its center, light yet reigns.</p>
<p>The crone then moves her wrinkled hand to the left-most card—the first. She closes her eyes and tilts her head, as if listening to an unspoken word. The arcane lights swirl and then shift, their colors changing to a deep, piercing blue.</p>
<p>"This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy."</p>
<p>She flips the card.</p>
<p>The cerulean light dances across its surface, revealing an illustration of a smirking guardsman looking up at a haughty priest, the priest’s pointing fingers mere inches from the guardsman’s nose as the guardsman readies a wickedly curved dagger behind his back. “The Nine of Glyphs—the Traitor.” Her dark pupils shift from side to side, as though reading from an unseen text. "I see the ancient foe of an old and noble house. The lost soul will lead you to him."</p>
<p>She moves her hand to the second card, this one at the top of the cross. As she closes her eyes and listens once more, the candlelight flares, its color bursting into a fierce, cheery yellow.</p>
<p>"This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope." She flips the card.</p>
<p>This time, the light reveals a new illustration: an armored warrior clutching a cracked iron sword and a leather-bound wooden shield, his face obscured by a heavy iron helmet. “The Five of Swords—the Myrmidon.” Her eyes stare deep into the darkness that lurks beyond the candlelight. (See <span class="citation">Swords (Spades), p. 12</span>, for this card’s foretelling.)</p>
<p>She moves her hand to the third card, at the right arm of the cross, her eyelids closing like a trance, her lips pursed in quiet contemplation. The candlelight vanishes, for a heartbeat—and then returns in a nova of fierce, burning white, so pure and strong and clean that it hurts to look at, burns to see—</p>
<p>Madam Eva's eyes snap open, burning with a fierce determination.</p>
<p>"This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight." She flips the card.</p>
<p>The light reveals a third illustration: a solemn-faced man clad in holy vestments, one hand clutching the chain of a bronze censer that billows with burning smoke. “The Eight of Glyphs—the Bishop.” The crone's voice is strong with purpose. (See <span class="citation">Glyphs (Hearts), p. 14</span>, for this card’s foretelling.)</p>
<p>She moves to the fourth card, at the bottom of the cross, and listens once more, tracing small circles across its back as she hums a contemplative note. The magic flames leap and dance upon their wicks, now casting swirling violet embers into the air as the graves beyond shimmer with a twilit glow.</p>
<p>"This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness."</p>
<p>She flips the card.</p>
<p>This time, the illustration revealed is a quiet graveyard choked with fog, its entrance sealed with a sharp iron fence. "The Mists." Madam Eva leans forward. (See <span class="citation">Strahd’s Enemy, p. 15</span>, for this card’s foretelling.)</p>
<p>Finally, she moves her hand to the fifth card—and nearly recoils, her brow furrowing until the wrinkles split her forehead like a trench. Behind her, shadows encircle the candlelight until the light is very nearly swallowed by the creeping dark. When next she speaks, Madam Eva's rasping voice is scarce above a whisper.</p>
<p>"Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. When the hour of judgment arrives, this card will lead you to him!"</p>
<p>Her hand trembles above the card for a silent moment—and then deft, ancient fingers reveal its opposite side.</p>
<p>In the darkness, the fifth and final illustration is only barely visible through the smoke and unnatural murk. Upon the card's surface dwells a depiction of a crowned, grinning emperor clad in royal finery and reaching for a goblet of wine—though his limbs are wooden puppet’s limbs, lashed to corded strings that disappear into the darkness overhead.</p>
<p>Madam Eva slowly exhales. "The Marionette." (See <span class="citation">Strahd’s Location in the Castle, p. 17</span>, for this card’s foretelling.)</p>
<p>As the last syllable passes her lips, the old woman freezes—and then rocks backwards, her eyes rolling until their whites gleam like pearls in the darkness—and then she snaps back, the candlelight burning down to its ordinary crimson glow.</p>
<p>The sound of the natural world returns—the whispering of the wind through the trees, the distant hooting of an owl, and the faraway lapping of the Ivlis River against its banks. Silver moonlight once again pierces the cemetery's edge, and you feel yourselves breathe for the first time since the reading began.</p>
<p>Madam Eva says nothing. She only regards you silently with dark, heavy eyes.</p></div>

Madam Eva refuses to elaborate on the players’ readings or provide any additional information or assistance. If asked to, she says only, “The threads of Fate cannot be beckoned like a servant or conjured like a magician’s trick. I see only what the cards show me, and no more.” 

Madam Eva dismisses the players from her presence once she has completed the Tarokka reading, instructing them to return to Tser Pool and to "tell no servant of Strahd of what they have just heard." 

Madam Eva declines to return with the players, preferring instead to linger at the crossroads. If asked why, she shares only that the place holds "special memories" for her, and that she will return to Tser Pool when she is ready. "Fear not," she rasps, a twinkle of amusement in her eyes. "I have little to fear from the creatures that prowl these woods, I assure you." If the players depart the crossroads and later return, they find that Madam Eva has vanished.

> [!lore]+ **Why Madam Eva Remains**
> Adventurers who sought to kill Strahd are not the only ones buried at this cemetery. Madam Eva's mother, the Vistana with whom King Barov II had an affair, is buried in the woods a short distance away from the gallows. (It is common for Vistani to bury their dead at crossroads, believing that doing so frees the spirit to guide others who follow the paths they once traveled.)

**_Milestone_**. Receiving the Tarokka reading completes a story milestone. When the party departs the crossroads, award each player 500 XP.
## C4g. Departing Tser Pool
When the players awaken at Tser Pool the following morning, Stanimir invites them to break their fast with him around the cold fire. Breakfast, which Arturi attends if able, includes cornmeal polenta, stuffed cabbage rolls, and fried bread. (If her treachery was not revealed the previous night, Eliza cheerfully joins the players for breakfast as well.)

If the players attempt to speak with Madam Eva again before departing, Stanimir warns them that "the old woman" is asleep, and does not wish to be disturbed. If the players attempt to enter her tent, they find her asleep on a pallet beside her table.
# C5. The Skeletal Rider
When the players return to the River Ivlis Crossroads after receiving the Tarokka reading, they encounter a skeletal rider, as described in <span class="citation">Skeletal Rider (p. 31)</span>, which approaches from the western road and continues toward the village of Barovia. If the players saw Dalvan Olensky’s corpse upon entering Barovia, they notice that the rider’s clothing is recognizably similar to his.

> [!abstract]+ **Following the Rider**
> If followed, the rider continues to ignore the players. After traveling a short distance down the road, it turns south down an old hunting path into the woods, which it follows east toward Barovia's eastern border. (The rider is roaming randomly, and has no particular destination.)
# C6. The Watchtower
As the players travel west from the River Ivlis Crossroads, read:

<div class="description"><p>You leave the crossroads behind and resume your westward journey. You follow the road as it bends around, then ascends the cliff, trudging up its steep, rocky incline. </p>
<p>The fog is thick here, obscuring the top of the cliff overhead. The road itself grows narrow and treacherous, with loose stones and deep ruts that make it difficult to maintain your footing. </p>
<p>Soon enough, though, the road levels out, continuing past a ruined three-story watchtower perched atop the edge of the cliff. </p>
<p>The tower's old stone walls are covered in moss and ivy, its rotten wooden door hanging off its hinges. Nearby, two fresh graves sit against the road. An animal's corpse seems to lie in the tall grass not far away.</p></div>

Pause to allow the players to act or react. If the players remain silent, continue to [[#C7. The Wolves' Hunt]] below. Otherwise, allow the players to explore the area.
## The Watchtower
The ruined watchtower was built as a lookout post by the Order of the Silver Dragon long ago. It has the same structure as the <span class="citation">Guard Tower (p. 157)</span> at Tsolenka Pass, with the following changes:

* The tower door has been half-pulled from its hinges and can be opened easily.
* The temperature and wind in the tower are far less severe.
* There is no dire wolf's head mounted above the hearth.
* There are neither statues nor skeletons atop the battlements.

If the players explore the watchtower, they find a broken silver pendant carved to resemble a dragon lying on the ground of the first floor, close to the entrance. The pendant is always cold to the touch.

From atop the battlements of the watchtower, the players can see Tser Falls to the northwest and Tser Pool to the northeast. To the south, above and beyond the slopes of Mount Ghakis, they can see only an impenetrable wall of thick, gray fog.
## The Graves
The two graves hold the remains of two Barovian refugees who were slain by wolves during the journey to Vallaki some time ago. A DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals that the graves are no more than a few weeks old.

Small pebbles have been arranged in the soil atop each grave to form the shape of a rising sunburst.
## The Corpse
The corpse belongs to a wolf killed by spears and crossbow bolts, and has mostly rotted away. The Barovian refugees left it here after slaying it and driving off the other members of its pack.
# C7. The High Road
The journey from the River Ivlis Crossroads to Tser Falls is seven-and-a-half miles long, or two-and-a-half hours.
## C7a. The Ravine
As the players continue down the road, read:

<div class="description"><p>You continue down the winding mountain road, the jagged peaks looming ominously through the fog far above. </p>
<p>The air grows colder as the road passes through a dark evergreen forest, the thick canopy once more blocking out much of the sky's dim light. Here, the road grows narrow, its edges passing above steep, craggy slopes as it winds around a mountain spur. The only sounds that follow you are the crunching of fallen leaves and an occasional rustling in the underbrush.</p></div>

If one of the players has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher, or if one of the players makes a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check, add:

<div class="description"><p>As your footsteps squelch into the old, muddy road, you glimpse a flicker of movement in the underwood: a flash of gray fur, amber eyes, and sharp, white teeth. Then, as soon as it appeared, it vanishes, skulking back into the shadows.</p></div>

The movement belongs to a **wolf**, which swiftly retreats into the woods. Its four **wolf** packmates are not far behind, keeping a distance of two hundred feet as they stalk the players through the woods.

If the players continue, read:

<div class="description"><p>As the road curves around the edge of the mountain, the right-hand cliffs fall away, leaving a sheer drop to a wooded ravine below. The road, now barely ten feet wide, bends up ahead, doubling back around this ravine before plunging dramatically and winding around a smaller mountain peak. </p>
</div>

If one of the players has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher, or if one of the players makes a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check, add:

<div class="description">
<p>You see three gray-furred shadows dart through the underbrush ahead. Two more flicker at the edge of your vision, just behind you.</p>
</div>

If one of the players has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 18 or higher, or if one of the players makes a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check, add:

<div class="description">
<p>A sixth lurks in the ravine nearly fifty feet below, keeping pace with your movements as it clings to the shadows of the crags.</p>
</div>

If the players pause, proceed, or attack, the five wolves in the woods strike. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>Five snarling shadows launch from the underbrush, fangs bared and claws outstretched!</p>
</div>
  
> [!combat]- **Balancing the Wolves** 
> This combat encounter is a bloody encounter against a party of five 3rd-level players, a CR 1 ally (Ireena Kolyana), and a CR 0 ally (Muriel in raven form), and will consume approximately 58% of their total maximum hit points. For parties of smaller or larger sizes, modify the encounter as follows: 
> * **Three Players**. Reduce the number of wolves to 3. 
> * **Four Players**. Reduce the number of wolves to 4. 
> * **Six Players**. Reduce the number of wolves to 1 and increase the number of werewolves to 2.

Replace the wolves' ***bite*** attack with the following action options:

* ***Maul.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the wolf can grapple the target (escape DC 11).
* ***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 11 Strength saving throw. On a failure, it is knocked prone or pushed 5 feet away (wolf's choice).

In combat, the **wolves** target a single player at a time, using their ***pack tactics*** to gain advantage on attack rolls and their ***claws*** attacks to attempt to knock a player into the gully. 

A player that falls into the ravine tumbles 50 feet down, taking 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage and falling prone. The sixth wolf uses its ***maul*** to attack any creature that falls into the ravine, then drags them away in the hopes of an easy meal. A creature that clings to the cragged edge at the bottom of the ravine has half cover from creatures atop the ravine.

Once a player falls into the ravine, the rest of the pack flees into the woods, then descends into the ravine by another path to assist the sixth wolf in pulling its prey away. The pack flees if four of the six wolves are killed.

> [!info]+ **Descending Into the Ravine**
> A player attempting to ascend or descend the edge of the ravine must make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check succeeds, the character moves at half speed up or down the edge of the ravine, as desired. On a check result of 6-9, the character neither gains nor loses ground; on a result of 5 or less, the character falls and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the base of the ravine.

As the players depart this area, a player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or greater notices two wolves, slightly larger than the others, watching them from atop an eastern mountain crag that rises above the tree line. A player who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check discerns that the wolves appear to be surveying them with a patient intelligence unusual for a wolf. The wolves turn and vanish from sight if noticed or interacted with.

> [!lore]+ **The Watching Wolves**
> The two wolves are **werewolves** in wolf form. Bloodthirsty brutes loyal to Kiril Stoyanovich and Strahd von Zarovich, they will reappear to stalk the players in [[#C11. The Werewolves' Hunt]].
## C7b. Tser Falls
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 2: Area H.</em></span>

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">Tser Falls (p. 37)</span>. Additionally, when the players arrive, they can see a <span class="citation">revenant (p. 31)</span> standing alone at the midpoint of the bridge with its hands resting on the pommel of its sword, the blade of which is planted firmly on the ground. 

![[Bridge Revenant.png]]
<span class="credit">"Bridge Revenant" by Caleb Cleveland. Support him on <a href="https://patreon.com/calebisdrawing/">Patreon!</a></span>

> [!lore]+ **Vladimir’s Fury**
>
> This nameless **revenant** was banished, along with a dozen of its peers, from the ruins of Argynvostholt shortly after the failure of Doru’s rebellion three months ago.
>
> When news of Strahd’s planned counterstroke reached them, the knights of the Order of the Silver Dragon raised their voices, begging Vladimir Horngaard to allow them to lend their swords to the cause.
>
> Vladimir denied them and, when the knights grew enraged and unruly, banished them from the manor and forbade them from raising their swords against Strahd or any of his creatures. Now, only Sir Godfrey Gwilym, Vladimir Horngaard, and the spirits of the **phantom warriors** that once fought for the Order remain in Argynvostholt.

If the players call out to this nameless **revenant** or step onto the bridge, it hails them in a raspy voice and asks their business. Upon hearing their response, it says, "Old things are stirring and the lord of Castle Ravenloft roams the valley. Tell me: Do you serve him?"

If the players claim to serve Strahd, the revenant visibly stiffens, but stands aside, saying coldly, "Then be gone on your way, and may your foul work bring you ruin and despair."

If the players deny serving Strahd, the revenant is visibly relieved and invites them to approach so that it may "get a closer look at them." It introduces itself as a knight of the Order of the Silver Dragon, but claims to have long forgotten its name in life. 

If the players' weapons are clearly visible, it asks the players if they oppose the lord of Castle Ravenloft. If the players claim to oppose Strahd, the revenant advises them to travel to Argynvostholt to the west, where Sir Godfrey Gwilym awaits those who would raise their swords against the darkness that lurks in the castle's depths.

If the players inquire about the Order of the Silver Dragon, the revenant shares only that the knights of the Order opposed the lord of Ravenloft in life and suggests that the players speak with Sir Godfrey to obtain further information. If the players obtained the silver pendant in the watchtower by the River Ivlis Crossroad, the revenant recognizes it, but refuses to comment further on its significance.

If the players ask the revenant why it is guarding the bridge, it says only, "Because I raised my voice against my commander and was banished. Now, I stand like my brothers- and sisters-in-arms, watching the dark places of this land and awaiting an order that will never come." 

If the players ask why it cannot take up arms against Strahd itself, it says only, "Because my commander forbids it, and my spirit is bound from disobeying his will." It is willing to share that its commander's name is Sir Vladimir Horngaard, but is unwilling to share more, advising the players to speak with Sir Godfrey instead.

> [!abstract]+ **Secrets of Amber**
> If the players ask the revenant about the "amber doors" mentioned in Madam Eva's Tarokka reading, it stiffens, then warns the players that they "meddle with things that ought not be meddled with." If the players reassure the revenant that their interest in the "amber doors" is directed at Strahd's defeat, the revenant hesitates, then informs them it is "bound never to reveal the secrets of that which we once guarded," but shares that Sir Godfrey can provide the information they seek.

> [!info]+ **The Oathbound Revenant**
> Each revenant of the Order of the Silver Dragon has been bound by the effects of Vladimir Horngaard's ***oathbind*** feature, which binds them to obey Vladimir's express commands. The revenants of the Order, excepting Sir Godfrey Gwilym, have been given the following commands:
> 
> * Do not betray the secrets of the Order of the Silver Dragon.
> * Raise no weapon against the vampire Strahd von Zarovich, his servants, or his creatures.
> * Do not return to Argynvostholt.
>   
> A revenant that violates one of these commands suffers the effects of a *geas* spell and is restrained until the start of its next turn by spiked black wires. (This effect can trigger any number of times each day. Because the revenants are bound by the oaths they swore to Vladimir in life, this effect can't be dispelled.)

If the players ask for directions to Argynvostholt, the revenant advises them to travel "west, beyond the walled town, then south upon the ash-gray path."

If the players mention Strahd's carriage, the revenant notes its disgust for "the beast von Zarovich" and advises the players to be cautious of him and his servants and spies. If the players mention the skeletal rider, the revenant shares that "the Wandering One seeks a road to freedom through the mists. It will never succeed."

Before the players depart, the revenant warns them to beware "those who walk in the skins of wolves," who haunt the forests to the west. "Once, they did not trouble those who traveled the roads," it rasps. "Something has changed, however, and now, their hunger for human flesh cannot be sated." (The revenant doesn't know where to find the werewolves' den, or any further information about the pack.)

The revenant will not leave its post on the bridge under any circumstances.
# C8. Black Carriage
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 2: Area I.</em></span>

The journey from Tser Falls to the <span class="citation">Black Carriage (p. 37)</span> is one-and-a-half miles and takes thirty minutes. As the players make this journey, read:

<div class="description"><p>You continue down the winding road, which climbs a short distance north before bending west to avoid a bald-headed peak on the right, its craggy cliffs bearing an array of sharp rocks that jut out over the roadway.</p>
<p>It's not long before the road bends north once again, a second hill arising from the fog on your left. Twisted trees dot its steep slopes, their branches reaching out like gnarled fingers.</p>
<p>As you travel deeper between the hills, the road narrows and the cliffs grow taller. Soon, though, the hills fall away once more, the road continuing forth into a small, fog-choked basin.</p></div>

This area is as described in <span class="citation">Black Carriage (p. 37)</span>. (Strahd's carriage is not present, though the players can see deep grooves in the muddy road that pass from the Old Svalich Road onto the old cobblestone-strewn thoroughfare that leads to Castle Ravenloft.)

The journey from the Black Carriage to the western **Gates of Barovia** is a quarter-mile and takes five minutes. This area is as described in <span class="citation">Gates of Barovia (p. 33)</span>, but seen from the opposite side.

> [!abstract]+ **Visiting Castle Ravenloft**
> If the players decide to visit Castle Ravenloft (e.g., to investigate Gertruda's disappearance), the journey from the crossroads is two-and-one-half miles long and takes fifty minutes. When the players arrive, the exterior of the castle is as described in [[Arc P - Ravenloft Heist#P2b. Approaching the Castle|Arc P - Ravenloft Heist]].
# C9. Old Bonegrinder
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 6: Area O.</em></span>

The journey from the Gates of Barovia to **Old Bonegrinder** is two-and-a-half miles long and takes forty-five minutes. As the players make this journey, read:

<div class="description"><p>The road continues forward, passing between a patch of dark woods. The air here is as quiet as the grave, the trees standing perfectly still in the unnerving silence.</p>
<p>Not far from the road, nestled in the overgrown underbrush, stands a mossy stone slab standing just under six feet in height. It rests on an old, cracked stone circle, and seems to bear some kind of carving.</p></div>

Briefly pause to allow the players to act or react. If the players choose to investigate the slab, they find that it bears a crude carving of a raven over an engraved three-pointed star, the grooves lined with lichen and moss. (The slab is an ancient monument to the Seeker, and the three-pointed star the symbol of the Ladies Three.)

If the players remain silent or continue ahead, read:

<div class="description"><p>The road soon emerges from the woods once more, veering between two hills. Before long, it bends to the north, hugging the base of a mountain.</p></div>

The players emerge at the base of the hill upon which **Old Bonegrinder** rests, as described in <span class="citation">Approaching the Windmill (p. 125)</span>. There are no ravens at or near the windmill. 

As the windmill comes into view, the players also notice **Morgantha** approaching from the opposite direction with her cart, as described in <span class="citation">Dream Pastries (p. 48)</span>. 

This scene largely unfolds as described in <span class="citation">Dream Pastries (p. 48)</span>, but Morgantha is coming from the town of Vallaki, not the village of Barovia, and she doesn't have a child stuffed into a sack in her peddler's cart.

> [!profile]+ **Morgantha, Dream Peddler**
> **Roleplaying Information**
> ***Resonance.*** At the time the players meet her, Morgantha should inspire flattery and comfort with her grandmotherly charm, gratitude for her willingness to share compliments and "free samples," endearment for her complaints about the mundane trials of an old woman's life, and slight wariness of her confidence and comfort traveling alone on a dangerous road.
> 
> ***Emotions.*** Morgantha most often appears to feel cheerful, amused, or thoughtful.
> 
> ***Motivations.*** Morgantha wants to keep her cover, keep her business operating peacefully, make strangers feel endeared to and comfortable with her, and encourage others to try her dream pastries if they appear inclined to do so.
> 
> ***Inspirations.*** Granny Weatherwax (*Discworld*), Minerva McGonagall (*Harry Potter*), Dr. Kureha (*One Piece*)
> 
> **Character Information**
> ***Persona.*** To the world, Morgantha is a cheerful old lady with a love for gossip and complaining. Only Morgantha and her daughters know that she is secretly the black-hearted matron of a night hag coven.
> 
> ***Morale.*** In a fight, Morgantha would attempt to parlay for peace, then use her ***etherealness*** ability to escape into the Ethereal Plane if doing so appears fruitless.
> 
> ***Relationships.*** Morgantha is the mother of the **night hags** Bella and Offalia, and the dream-pastry dealer for the Barovian refugee [[Arc H - The Lost Soul#I3b. Franz’s Tent|Franz]].

Morgantha greets the players warmly, calling them "weary travelers," and shares her hope that the road has not been too hard on them. She freely shares the following information if asked:

* She is a peddler who sells baked wares to the "good people of Barovia."
* She is just returning from a day peddling her goods to the townsfolk of Vallaki and the "poor, hungry dears" camped outside the gates. (Her latter comment is referring to a camp of Barovian refugees that has not been allowed to enter the town.)
* She lives in the old windmill up the hill with her two daughters, Bella and Offalia. (She kindly declines to share what happened to her "husband," saying only, "Now, that's an old woman's business, meant to be shared only if she chooses.")

Morgantha has a few "dream pastries" left from her workday—"filled with the light and love of dreaming"—which she offers to the players for free as a "first sample." She advises the players that the dream pastries taste best after a warm meal, "especially with a nice bit of wine to wash them down." (The dream pastries, if eaten, affect the players as described in **Dream Pastries**, p. 125.)

If asked how she manages to travel the roads safely, Morgantha only smiles and promises the players that "an old woman has her tricks." ("But," she complains, "my back and poor feet do complain from time to time. I can't wait to soak them in a tub of nice, hot water once I'm home.")

If the players ask to enter her home, Morgantha apologizes for her lack of hospitality, but notes that she's tired and not prepared for visitors, besides. (The players are welcome, she says, to visit another day if they'd like.)

When the conversation runs out of steam, Morgantha bids the players a safe journey, and lets them know that they can find her outside of Vallaki's gates in the future, should they like to purchase additional pastries.

Before she departs, Morgantha warns the players that the guards at the Vallaki gates are confiscating silver coins and visible silver items from travelers as a tax. "But," she says, tapping her nose with a cheeky, half-toothed grin, "you didn't hear it from me."

> [!abstract]+ **Morgantha Detected**
> If a player discerns Morgantha's fiendish nature, such as by using a paladin's ***divine sense***, and confronts her about it, she pauses, then congratulates them on their perceptiveness. She then smiles sweetly and notes she is breaking no laws, asking: "Is it a crime to be as one was made?" If the player insisted on attacking her, she adds: "And does such a crime demand immediate execution?"
> 
> If the players insist that it does, she immediately kneels, pleading sarcastically for mercy and an opportunity to repent. "Allow me to return to my home and reflect upon my sins," she adds, grinning. If attacked, she vanishes using her ***etherealness*** feature, cackling. 
> 
> If the players approach the windmill, she notifies Bella and Offalia, who join her in the Ethereal Plane. If the players attempt to damage or destroy the windmill, the hags then return to the Material Plane and warn them to stop on pain of death. See [[Arc H - The Lost Soul#Morgantha Gets Suspicious|Morgantha Gets Suspicious]] for more information on conflict with the hags. (The windmill currently doesn't contain any children, and won't until [[Arc H - The Lost Soul]] begins.)
# C10. The Deep Woods
The journey from Old Bonegrinder to the **Town of Vallaki** is five-and-three-quarter miles long and takes two hours. As the players make this journey, read:

<div class="description"><p>The winding valley road hugs the mountainside as it meanders north. The dark woods cling to the opposite side of the road, the tall, gnarled trees creeping as close as they dare. You can hear the sound of the wind rustling through the leaves and the occasional creak of branches. From time to time, it almost sounds like the trees are whispering among themselves, or stirring their ancient roots in the old, rotten mulch.</p>
<p>As the road continues, the forest swallows it up on both sides. The trees towering far above your heads, blocking out all but the barest hints of gray light. The air grows thick and heavy with the scent of moss and rotting leaves; in the distance, you hear a raven's gurgling croak, followed by the sound of fluttering wings.</p>
<p>Before long, it becomes clear that your presence in this dreary land has not gone unnoticed. A raven follows you for several minutes while keeping a respectful distance.</p></div>

This encounter unfolds as described in <span class="citation">Swarms of Ravens (p. 32)</span>, with the party joined by two **swarms of ravens**. If she is with the party and able to fly, the disguised Muriel takes wing alongside the flock, but keeps a sharp eye on the players as they travel. 

As the players proceed down the road, read:

<div class="description"><p>Ahead, the trees to the north break, revealing a grassy field. The tall grasses sway in the chill air, the field stretching until it reaches the shores of a dark, distant lake. Fog clings to the shoreline. Even from a distance, you can hear the faint sound of water lapping against the rocks.</p></div>

If [[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is with the party, she freezes and asks the players if the party can take a quick detour across the field to the lake. If asked, she notes only that the lake seems strangely familiar.

Lake Zarovich is as described in <span class="citation">L. Lake Zarovich (p. 38)</span>, but without the beached rowboats or Bluto's boat visible. 

Upon arriving at the shore of the lake, Ireena notes with trepidation that it appears to be the same lake that she has seen in her dreams. (If she hasn't already shared it, Ireena tells the story of her dream, described in [[#C4d. The Dancing Fire]] above.)

Ireena is certain, however, that she has never visited this lake with Ismark and her father, Kolyan. She is uncertain of the implications, but becomes lost in thought if a player reminds her that her father found her wandering the Old Svalich Woods as a child.
# C11. The Werewolves' Hunt
As the players continue down the road, read:

<div class="description"><p>As quickly as it appeared, the field is swallowed up by the forest again, the trees closing in around you once more. The dark undergrowth rustles and stirs in the wind, and the weight of the forest presses in from all sides. You're unable to shake the sense that, somehow, you're being watched.</p></div>

If one of the players has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher, or if one of the players makes a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check, add:

<div class="description">
<p>A humanoid shadow flickers in the distance—then vanishes from sight.</p>
</div>

The shadow belongs to a **werewolf**. Its companions—three **wolves** and an additional **werewolf**—lurk in the woods nearby.

The werewolves don't attack immediately, preferring to wait for the perfect time to strike. If the players continue down the road, read:

<div class="description"><p>The woodland road takes you through a small, forested clearing, the circular treeline littered with dense thickets, moss-covered boulders, and craggy ridges.</p>
<p>Then, without warning, five wolves leap from the forest, yellow eyes glinting as their muzzles curl into snarls!</p></div>

Have the players, **wolves**, **werewolves** (in wolf form), and (if they are with the party) Ireena, the two **swarms of ravens**, and Muriel (a **wereraven** in raven form) roll initiative. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score lower than 14 is surprised.

Modify the wolves' statblocks as described in [[#C7a. The Ravine]]. In addition, use the statblock below for the werewolves, rather than the one in the *Monster Manual*:

<div class="statblock">

<p><strong><em>Keen Hearing and Smell.</em></strong> The werewolf has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pack Tactics.</em></strong> The werewolf has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the werewolf's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> The werewolf regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the werewolf takes necrotic damage or bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a silvered weapon, this trait doesn't function at the start of the werewolf's next turn. The werewolf dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The werewolf makes two attacks: two with its spear (humanoid form) or one with its bite and one with its claws (wolf or hybrid form).</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite (Wolf or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the werewolf can grapple the target (escape DC 11). Additionally, if the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werewolf lycanthropy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claws (Wolf or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spear (Humanoid Form Only).</em></strong> Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, or 6 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Shapechange.</em></strong> The werewolf polymorphs into a wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying melds into the new form. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p>
</div>


In combat, the **wolves** work together, using their ***Claws*** to knock characters prone, then using their ***Maul*** to grapple prone targets. Once the wolves have dragged a grappled character away from the party, the **werewolves** shift their attention to target them with its ***bite***. The first character targeted in this way notices that the werewolves are slightly larger than the other two and have intelligent, disturbingly human eyes.

A werewolf flees if it begins its turn with 20 hit points or fewer and doesn’t regenerate, or if it begins its turn with 0 hit points on three turns in a row. Any surviving wolves follow soon after. 

If the werewolves die, they reverts to their true forms: a young man with pale, freckled skin and a lean, muscled frame, and a brawny young man with a cruel face and dark, oily hair. Each bears a bloody, raw, and blighted wound on his side—the source of the their lycanthropic affliction. 

Any players who failed their saving throw against the curse of lycanthropy soon find that, although they regain hit points normally, the original wound remains cosmetically bloody and raw—just as described in Van Richten's manuscript on the werewolf's curse. The next full moon takes place on the night of the sixth day after the players’ arrival in Vallaki.

> [!info]+ **Lycanthropy in Barovia**
>
> In Barovia, the curse of lycanthropy spreads as described in **Player Characters as Lycanthropes** (<span class="citation">Monster Manual, p. 207</span>). However, an infected player or other creature does not automatically receive any changes to their ability scores or Armor Class, nor do they automatically receive the benefits of the lycanthrope's stat block (e.g., immunities or regeneration).
>
> Instead, an infected creature only receives the benefits of lycanthropy upon transforming into their hybrid form on the night of the full moon. During this time, the creature becomes an NPC under the DM's control until dawn, at which point the creature loses the benefits of lycanthropy.
>
> An infected creature can embrace the curse of lycanthropy—and so gain its full benefits—by completing a certain task, depending on the nature of their curse:
>
> - An infected **werewolf** must voluntarily kill an innocent humanoid, without fear or hatred, and devour their flesh.
> - An infected **wereraven** must be knocked unconscious while voluntarily attempting to protect another humanoid from (what they believe to be) near-certain death.
>
> An infected lycanthrope can be recognized by the scar of the wound that originally transmitted the curse. The wound will never entirely heal, and remains raw and bloody until the curse is lifted.
>
> The child of two lycanthropes possesses the full benefits of lycanthropy from birth, and may learn to control their curse as they age. A child born with lycanthropy in this way cannot be cured except by means of a *wish* spell.
>
> Finally, while the mists remain, the lunar cycle is accelerated in Barovia: the full moon arrives once every two weeks, instead of once every four. **The first full moon that the players experience takes place on Neyavr 8th—the sixth night after they first arrive in Vallaki.**

> [!abstract]+ **Curing Player Lycanthropy**
> The players can learn from the Martikovs of the Blue Water Inn, Dr. Rudolph van Richten, or Kasimir Velikov of the Vallakian Vistani encampment that the next full moon will take place on their sixth night after first entering Vallaki. As the night of the full moon approaches, players infected with lycanthropy experience nightmares of increasing severity, as well as an increasing appetite for raw meat.
> 
> Players infected with **werewolf** lycanthropy will be able to search for a cure in [[Arc I - The Walls of Krezk]] after meeting Dr. Rudolph van Richten in [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana]]. Players of an appropriate class can also cure themselves and others of lycanthropy by casting *remove curse* upon reaching 5th level. (Father Lucian of St. Andral's Church in Vallaki cannot cast the spell and therefore cannot cure lycanthropy.)

> [!warning]+ **Embracing Werewolf Lycanthropy**
> As noted in [[Session Zero]], this campaign is designed for heroic player characters, rather than villainous ones. As such, it is incompatible with characters who choose to embrace **werewolf** lycanthropy by killing and devouring an innocent humanoid. If a player expresses any interest in doing so, warn them that embracing the curse will result in their current character being turned into a villainous NPC, requiring them to create a new character instead.
# C12. The Town of Vallaki
## C12a. The Vallakian Gates
The road continues forward to the **Town of Vallaki**, largely as described in <span class="citation">Approaching the Town (p. 95)</span>. However, remove the first sentence of the descriptive text and add the following text at the end of the first paragraph: 

<div class="description"><p>More than a dozen ramshackle tents have been set up against the palisade wall. Among them, dozens of ragged, emaciated people mill about or sit by low-burning campfires and bedrolls, their hollow gazes watching silently as you approach.</p></div>

If the players departed from Tser Pool that morning, they arrive in Vallaki at dusk.

If [[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is visibly traveling with the party, add:

<div class="description"><p>Some of them regard Ireena with dull recognition, but none lift a hand in greeting or make any gesture of warmth.</p></div>

This area, the Morning Gate, is largely as described in <span class="citation">Town Gates (p. 95)</span>. The tents are a camp of Barovian refugees, housing those who survived the trek from the village of Barovia in the wake of Strahd's siege.
### The Refugee Camp
If she is with the party, [[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is heartbroken and enraged at the sight of the refugee camp. She suggests that she meet with the refugees while the players find lodging in town, and promises to join the players later. The players can dissuade her with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Otherwise, Ireena approaches one of the cookfires, either alone or—if the players have insisted on joining her—with company.

The members of the refugee camp, which include Emeric, a melancholy older man, and Magda, a grief-stricken young woman, can share the following information:

* The Barovian refugees arrived at Vallaki's gates a few weeks ago, but were barred from entering. When they attempted to breach the gates by force, the guards summoned a man they called Izek, who bore a twisted devil's arm and conjured fire to drive the refugees back.
* Since then, the refugees have set up camp outside the town's walls, clustering together for protection and warmth. They've managed to secure some minor necessities, such as the tents, by bribing the guards at the gates, but have been unable to persuade the guards to allow them entry or to even invite the town's Baron to discuss their plight.
* Swarms of bats and packs of wolves have plagued the camp each night since they've arrived. Thankfully, no one has died yet, but several refugees have been wounded.
* Due to losses they suffered on the road and the threat of the Devil in Castle Ravenloft, the refugees are unwilling to risk the journey back home, instead hoping to wait until the Baron sees reason and allows them to enter the walls.
* Roughly one-quarter of the refugees have become addicted to "dream pastries," a foodstuff sold by the peddler Morgantha. These refugees seek an escape from the misery and despair of their situation. Those who eat a dream pastry fall into a trance as described in <span class="citation">Dream Pastries (p. 125)</span>.

The refugees are lost in despair. Some recall a superstition that red-haired Barovian woman bring misfortune, and suggest that Ireena herself has brought a curse upon their people. Few have any wish to deal with her further.

Following her interaction with the refugees, Ireena is enraged by the Baron's callousness, and vows to make her best efforts to secure entry for the refugees into Vallaki. 
### The Guards at the Gates
The guards at the gates largely act as described in <span class="citation">Town Gates (p. 95)</span>. One has a silvered spear, while the other has a quiver containing a dozen crossbow bolts, half of which are silvered.

The guards demand that each person first identify themselves. Once identified, each player must show their teeth ("To prove you're not vampires.") and briefly be exposed to a necklace strung with bulbs of garlic ("To prove you're not werewolves"). (The Baron has, incorrectly, informed his guards that werewolves are severely allergic to garlic.)

The guards then demand each player pay 1 gold piece as a toll in order to enter the village. The guards refuse to accept payment on behalf of the refugees, whom the Baron has specifically barred from entering, claiming concerns of "sickness, unruliness, and malicious unhappiness."

If the players pay the toll, the guards also insist that each entrant opens their purse (or equivalent) and surrender any silver pieces in their possession. (If the players complain, the guards assure them that the silver is needed to produce the silvered weapons necessary to defend the town from werewolves.) In exchange for any silver coins that they give up, the players receive an amount of copper coins of equal value—minus a ten percent tax.

If asked about lodging, the guards can share information about the Blue Water Inn, as described in <span class="citation">Vallaki Lore (p. 96)</span>. The guards are also willing to provide additional directions to other landmarks in the town in exchange for a bribe of 1 gold piece.

Each time the players pass through the gates, including the first, the guards nod at them and intone the Baron's favored phrase: "All will be well."

> [!abstract]+ **Gertruda's Fate**
> If the players inquire about Gertruda's fate and provide a description, the guards truthfully share that they haven't seen anyone resembling her.
### Entering the Town
As the players pass down Vallaki's main avenue, read:

<div class="description"><p>You pass from the earthen road onto cobblestone streets, mud staining your boots and the bottoms of your pants. Behind you, the gates close with a slam, and you can see the guards resume their posts behind it. In the distance, you can see two other figures bearing pikes, patrolling the walls as they look down on the twisted forest beyond.</p>
<p>The eaves of the buildings hang with old banners and tattered fabrics that flap and twist in the chill breeze. The banners are painted with faded words and illustrations, but time has robbed them of both their legibility and any beauty they may have once had.</p>
<p>Flickering candlelight lingers behind the shuttered townhouse windows, and humanoid shadows move beyond closed curtains. Long shadows lurk in the alleyways, where the grass grows long and twisted beneath the stained and sagging wood of the buildings above. </p>
<p>The streets are empty, though you can see a single cloaked figure traveling away from you down the central road.  In the distance beyond the walls, a lone wolf howls, and a cold gust of wind cuts through the night like a knife.</p></div>

The cloaked figure is Willemina Rikalova, as described in <span class="citation">St. Andral's Church (p. 97)</span>. She is traveling to the church to pray for the freedom of her son, Udo Lukovich.

As the characters pass through the streets, they are noticed by Ernst Larnak, who intently watches them—though doesn't follow them—as described in <span class="citation">Lady Wachter's Wish (p. 124)</span>. (Ernst does not yet deliver an invitation to dine with Lady Wachter, though he does return to <span class="citation">N4. Wachterhaus (p. 110)</span> to report back to Lady Wachter when the players leave his sight.)
## C12b. The Blue Water Inn
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 5: Area N2.</em></span>

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">N2. Blue Water Inn (p. 98)</span>. If Muriel is present, she bids the players farewell with a soft, sentimental trill, then departs to join the other ravens resting atop the roof. (If the players later return to the inn to look for her, she is not present.)

When the players first arrive, the inn contains the following notable NPCs:

* Danika Dorakova, who is pouring drinks and serving patrons in **N2c. Taproom**; 
* Urwin Martikov, who is cooking bread and beet stew in **N2e. Kitchen**;
* Brom and Bray Martikov, who are playing with toys in **N20. Boys' Bedroom**; and
* Rictavio, who is telling stories to the patrons in **N2c. Taproom**, including Nikolai and Karl Wachter.

### Entering the Inn
The taproom is as described in <span class="citation">N2c. Taproom (p. 100)</span>. However, add the following text to the end of this area's description:

<div class="description">
<p>Nearly a dozen Vallakians sit scattered across the various tables, nursing mugs of wine or bowls of hearty stew. Along the staircase, a colorfully dressed man wearing a feathered, wide-brimmed hat gestures wildly at the head of a long table, holding the rapt attention of the several patrons sitting there. You hear a wave of laugher ripple through the group, followed by a smattering of light applause.</p>
</div>

The man is the ringmaster Rictavio, who is largely as described in <span class="citation">Rictavio (p. 238)</span> and <span class="citation">N2c. Taproom (p. 100)</span>. Two of the five listeners at his table are Nikolai and Karl Wachter, who are as described in <span class="citation">N2c. Taproom (p. 100)</span>.

When the players first enter the inn, [[Non-Player Characters#Danika Dorakova|Danika]], who is waiting tables, greets them and asks them to wait at the bar while she tends to other patrons.

If the characters approach the bar, [[Non-Player Characters#Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] exits the kitchen carrying a tray of fresh-baked bread, hot beet stew, and wolf steaks, which he sets down on the bar. (The food smells mouthwateringly delicious.) Szoldar Szoldarovich and Yevgeni Krushkin are also seated at the bar, and are as described in <span class="citation">N2c. Taproom (p. 100)</span>.

Urwin greets the players warmly and welcomes them to the Blue Water Inn. If the players don't direct the conversation elsewhere, he notes that they look like travelers and asks if they need rooms for the night.

Before Urwin can reply to the players, Danika returns and apologizes to the players for her delay. Assuming the players do not interrupt, the conversation then proceeds as follows:

* Danika lightheartedly accuses Urwin of plotting to rent rooms to guests "for free" again, an allegation that Urwin cheerfully denies. 
* Danika tells the players that Urwin has already allowed one other guest to stay free and would "bankrupt the inn" with generosity if she weren't there to keep the books. (Urwin graciously concedes the point.) 
* "After all," Urwin says cheekily, "why else did I marry you?" With a smile, Danika replies, "A rare instance of common sense, I imagine."
* Danika pecks Urwin's cheek with a kiss and says, "The table by the window is getting hungry." Urwin winks at the players, picks up the tray again, and exits the bar to deliver the food.

Danika then tells the players the rates for room and board, as listed in <span class="citation">N2. Blue Water Inn (p. 98)</span>. (Both the large guest room, <span class="citation">N2m. Guest Room (p. 102)</span>, as well as the two small guest rooms, <span class="citation">N2l. Guest Rooms (p. 102)</span>, are available for rent.) When Urwin returns, he offers to take the players' orders for dinner, assuming they're hungry. 

The players then have a few minutes to talk with Urwin and Danika or amongst themselves. During this conversation, Urwin and Danika can provide the players with information about Rictavio, the Festival of the Blazing Sun (which will take place in five days at noon), and the nearby Vistani camp, as described in <span class="citation">Vallaki Lore (p. 96)</span>. 

Both Urwin and Danika can provide directions to any major landmark inside of Vallaki, including **N1. St. Andral's Church**, **N5. Arasek Stockyard**, and **N8. Town Square**. If the players ask about the inn's other guest, Urwin and Danika can also share information about Rictavio, which is largely as described in <span class="citation">N2c. Taproom (p. 100)</span>, except that Rictavio first arrived that same morning.

The inn's most recent shipment of wine is slightly late, but has not been sufficiently delayed as to make Urwin alarmed. As such, he does not ask the players to investigate the Wizard of Wines at this point. (This quest will not become available until the players reach level 5. See [[Arc J - The Stolen Gem]] for more information.)

If the players order food or wine in the taproom, [[Non-Player Characters#Danika Dorakova|Danika]] offers to seat them at the long table at the south end of the taproom and promises that they'll be served shortly. (See **Map 5.2: Blue Water Inn**.)
### The Ringmaster's Tale
If any of the players approach Rictavio's table, Nikolai and Karl Wachter urge them to have a seat. "He's about to tell a story," Nikolai whispers loudly. (Szoldar Szoldarovich, the wolf hunter, has turned his chair away from the bar to listen in.)

> ***Relationships.*** Rictavio is secretly Dr. Rudolph van Richten, the famed vampire hunter.

After clearing his throat, Rictavio shares the following story:

<div class="description">
<p>The vampire Count Belasco kept his coffin, not in a crypt or keep, but in the cellar of an old, decrepit inn, which was managed by his servant, Igoron.</p>
<p>Poor Count Belasco had a terrible secret: In his ancient age, his scalp was beginning to rot, his hair falling out in great clumps and knots. In embarrassment, he commanded Igoron to purchase a beautiful raven-black wig, hoping to preserve the handsome, younger man he had once been.</p>
<p>"A handsome man indeed," agreed one of his guests—an elderly, near-blind widow named Olivenka—one particular moonlit night. Dear Olivenka kept to herself, spending her days sorting and re-sorting her late husband's rock collection, which she kept lovingly in her purse. Despite the Count's odd behavior and pale skin, she suspected nothing, her old vision too blurry to make out the fangs that poked down amidst his teeth.</p>
<p>As always, the Count felt an urge to feed upon her—and though her flattering words quelled his interest, he felt the thirst in his fangs all the same. "Igoron!" he boomed. "Fetch my coat—I'm going hunting."</p>
<p>"Yes, sire," Igoron wheezed. As he returned, he whimpered, "Best be back before dawn, milord. I'm cleaning the curtains tonight. Want you nice and safe in your coffin before sunrise."</p>
<p>Count Belasco scoffed. "Fear not, simple Igoron," he boasted. "I know well the hour of my enemy. Not a thing could stir my spirit to linger beneath its dreadful rays."</p>
<p>And so the Count departed. He lurked in alleyways and prowled across rooftops—yet he found not a single morsel to sate his thirst. It was with surprise, that the hungry, defeated Count finally looked up to the velvet skies and saw the periwinkle-grey of approaching morning.</p>
<p>With panic, he flew through the streets. Four blocks away. A streak of orange began to slice across the sky. Three blocks. Two—</p>
<p>—the door to the inn slammed shut behind him.</p>
<p>"Goodness," Olivenka said, yawning atop the staircase. "Have you been out all night?"</p>
<p>In an eyeblink, the Count's great silhouette towered far above her. "Yes," he growled. "But I've only just found what I've been looking for. Olivenka—<i>I want to suck your blood!</i>"</p>
<p>Ordinarily, one of Count Belasco's victims would scream, flee, or faint—yet he had made one, terrible mistake.</p>
<p>He had forgotten that Olivenka's cataract-ridden eyes couldn't quite see his fangs.</p>
<p>"You disgusting man!" Olivenka screeched, and whirled eighteen years' worth of rare rocks and minerals directly toward his head. There was a terrible thud—and a terrible splintering of wood—and Count Belasco went tumbling down to the floor below. When he opened his eyes, he saw Olivenka staring in horror, not at him, but at his <i>head</i>—his <i>bare</i> head.</p>
<p>There, just beneath the eastern window, lay his beloved wig. He dove for it, claws outstretched—and a sliver of sunlight grazed across his skin.</p> 
<p>There was a sizzle, a hiss, and a burst of smoke and flame. Olivenka, purse clutched to her chest, watched in awe as Count Belasco succumbed to the morning light, until all that remained was a smoldering heap of ash and a charred, smoking wig.</p>
</div>

"Poor Olivenka never quite got over it," Rictavio concludes, his eyes twinkling. "After all—it was quite the 'hair-raising' experience!" As his listeners boo, guffaw, and applaud, he bows, then waves to Danika for another round of drinks. As she approaches, Brom and Bray run past her into the kitchen, giggling.

If spoken with, Rictavio is willing to share the following information over drinks:

* He is Rictavio, a half-elf carnival ringmaster having traveled long and far in search of new acts for his circus. He's not entirely sure how he wound up in Barovia, but he's working to make the most of it. (This is a lie. A DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that Rictavio's words sound a bit too smooth and practiced.)
* He recently arrived that morning, and took up residence in the Blue Water Inn's private suite. "The good innkeepers have generously let me stay in exchange for tales and good humor," he notes, smiling.

During the conversation, Rictavio subtly attempts to learn more information than he reveals, hoping to glean the players' identities, capabilities, relationships, and histories in and beyond Barovia. If asked why he seems to be so curious, he bombastically insists that he's always in search of new tales to add to his repertoire.

When he's finished his drink, Rictavio takes another flourishing bow and excuses himself. As he does, Nikolai and Karl boo and urge Rictavio to tell another story. "We've heard one about a stupid Count," Nikolai says. "What about a stupid Baron?"

If the players don't intervene, the following sequence of events then occurs:

* The table and nearby taproom go silent, with many patrons eyeing Nikolai and Rictavio nervously.
* From his place at the bar, Szoldar rumbles, "Best not, boy." (Behind him, Yevgeni grunts, then echoes, "Best not.")
* Karl scoffs. "Cowards, the lot of you," he says, glancing about him. "Not a funny bone in your bodies."
* Rictavio clears his throat. "Alas, my friends," he says, "but the day has been long, and I must retire. Another day, perhaps." As Nikolai and Karl groan and turn back to their drinks, Rictavio bows with a flourish, then ascends the stairs to <span class="citation">N2n Private Guest Room (p. 102)</span>. 

Any player who watches as Rictavio makes his way along **N2j. Great Balcony** sees him pass Brom and Bray, who are crouched along the balcony in front of **N2o. Boys' Bedroom**. (The boys are dangling the stuffed bat described in <span class="citation">N2o. Boys' Bedroom (p. 102)</span> over the bar below, giggling while Nikolai and Karl drunkenly swat at it. The boys used the <span class="citation">N2i. Secret Stairs and Hall (p. 101)</span> to scamper quietly from the kitchen to the balcony while the players were drinking, unseen by the inn's patrons.)
### The Brothers Wachter
If the players linger at Rictavio's table, the Wachter brothers are happy (if prodded) to rant about:

- the Festival of the Blazing Sun,
- Vallaki's recent history of festivals,
- the Baron's response to those who speak ill of the festivals, and
- the flashes of purple light that have been seen from the attic of **N3. Burgomaster's Mansion**

(See <span class="citation">Vallaki Lore (p. 96)</span>). Once the players have won the brothers' trust, the conversation proceeds as described in <span class="citation">N2c. Taproom (p. 100)</span>.

Through conversation, it becomes evident that the brothers have a deep, personal enmity toward Izek Strazni and the Vallakovich family. However, neither brother will reveal the underlying reason—Stella Wachter's illness (see [[Arc H - The Lost Soul]])—unless the players ask and succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

At some point during the conversation, Danika approaches the table to clear away empty plates. As she does, Nikolai cheerfully demands more wine. If the players don't intervene, the conversation proceeds as follows:

- [[Non-Player Characters#Danika Dorakova|Danika]] greets Karl and Nikolai by name, and asks, "Haven't you already had too much to drink, boys?"
- Nikolai waves away her words and says, "Nonsense—we've only begun! Two pints of wine to start, and keep them coming."
- Danika replies, "Can I start you with some Purple Grapemash No. 3?" Nikolai scoffs and says, "What do you take us for—tasteless peasants? Red Dragon Crush, and don't be stingy."
- As she pours their wine, Danika says idly, "Does your mother know what you're up to this evening?" Karl waits until he receives his pint, then grunts, "Mother's far too busy these days. And what she doesn't know can't hurt her." ("Or us," Nikolai charms in, elbowing his brother. The two chuckle, then return to their drinks.)

If the players ask Urwin or Danika about the Wachter brothers, Urwin can tell them the information listed in <span class="citation">N2c. Taproom (p. 100)</span>. If the players ask about their mother, or about their words about a "stupid Baron," Urwin becomes visibly uneasy, and promises to speak with the players further in the morning.
### Eating Dinner
Shortly after Rictavio's story concludes, if the players ordered dinner, [[Non-Player Characters#Danika Dorakova|Danika]] approaches their table with a tray of food. As she serves them, she is suddenly jostled from behind, sending one of the bowls of soup tumbling from her grasp. The two players sitting at the northernmost end of the table must make DC 10 Dexterity saving throws, catching the bowl on a success. (If both players succeed, the player with the higher result catches the bowl first. If neither player succeeds, the bowl topples onto the floor, spilling the soup.) 

Danika turns, revealing the culprit: a red-cheeked Brom Martikov wearing one of the painted wooden clown masks as described in <span class="citation">N2o. Boy' Bedroom (p. 102)</span>. (Bray Martikov, wearing the other mask of the pair, is cowering behind one of the chairs of the nearest table.)

If the players do not interrupt, Danika scolds the boys as follows:

* Danika sharply (though not unkindly) addresses Brom and Bray by their full names. Both children snap to attention.
* Danika asks the boys, "What did your father tell you about wearing those masks in the taproom?" Both boys remove their masks, flushed, and Brom says, sheepishly, "We're not supposed to do it."
* Danika then asks the boys, "And what did I tell you about running in the taproom?" The two are quiet, then Bray pipes up, " . . . we're not s'posed to do it?" Danika replies, "Exactly."

If the soup was spilled, Danika directs Bray to fetch a pail of water from **N2a. Well** outside, and Brom to fetch a mop from the kitchen to clean up the mess. If the soup wasn't spilled, Danika reminds the boys that they're supposed to be helping their father cook dinner, and shoos them into the kitchen.

In either case, Danika apologizes to the players and offers them free meals the following evening. If the players ask about Brom and Bray, Danika smiles fondly and says, "They can be a handful sometimes, but they're good boys."

If the players ask about the children's masks, Danika tells them that Urwin bought them from the local toymaker, Gadof Blinsky, who works at <span class="citation">N7. Blinsky Toys (p.118)</span>.

The taproom slowly clears out over the following two hours. Nikolai and Karl Wachter stumble outside and collapse in the inn's shed, too drunk to make their way home.

If the players rented rooms for the night, [[Non-Player Characters#Danika Dorakova|Danika]] eventually approaches their table and offers to show them to their rooms. (See **N2l. Guest Rooms** and <span class="citation">N2m. Guest Room (p. 102)</span>). During the tour, Danika lets them know that they're free to request fresh linens or a tub of hot water (for a bath) be brought up to their rooms. "Breakfast is served at first light," she says warmly, and adds, "Feel free to let us know if you need anything else."

***Milestone.*** Arriving in Vallaki completes a story milestone. When the party takes its first long rest in Vallaki, award each player 1,000 XP, plus an additional 250 XP if they successfully escorted Ireena to Vallaki. (The players don't need to bring Ireena to St. Andral's church to receive this XP.)
## C12c. Morning in Vallaki
### Urwin's Advice
When the players first emerge from their rooms onto <span class="citation">N2k. Guest Balcony</span> the following morning, [[Non-Player Characters#Urwin Martikov|Urwin]]—who is taking down the chairs from the taproom tables—asks them to come downstairs to the bar to speak.

Lowering his voice, Urwin warns the players that they must be cautious in Vallaki—both due to the town's harsh system of law enforcement and recent political tensions. Urwin can share the following additional information, as described in <span class="citation">Vallaki Lore (p. 96)</span>:

* The date of the Festival of the Blazing Sun, which will take place from dawn to noon of the players' fifth full day in Vallaki,
* Vallaki's recent history of festivals,
* The Baron's strict rules regarding his festivals—and the fates of those who speak ill of them,
* The brutish nature and terrible strength of Izek Strazni, the baron's henchman. ("Many have tried to test his strength," Urwin notes grimly. "All have failed.")

Urwin quietly notes, however, that the Baron is known to be highly susceptible to flattery—and that should the players ever need to win his favor, his ego may be a prime target.

If the players ask whether the Baron has any enemies in Vallaki, Urwin can also share the information about Lady Fiona Wachter described in <span class="citation">Vallaki Lore (p. 96)</span>. However, instead of describing Lady Wachter's "mad daughter," Urwin shares only that Lady Fiona has a daughter, Stella Wachter, who Lady Wachter has recently kept cloistered on the grounds of Wachterhaus for unknown reasons.

As Urwin's conversation draws to a close, Rictavio descends the stairs from <span class="citation">N2n. Private Guest Room</span> and approaches the bar, greeting the players with a nod. Urwin bids him good morning and removes a small parcel from beneath the counter, which Rictavio accepts and tucks into his cloak.

> [!abstract]+ **What's In the Parcel?**
> If asked, Urwin can inform the players that the parcel merely contains food—a few apples, some loaves of bread, and a wheel of cheese.
### Following the Ringmaster
If one or more players follow Rictavio out of the Blue Water Inn, they can follow him to <span class="citation">N2f. Stable (p. 101)</span> without difficulty.

Once inside, Rictavio removes the parcel from his coat, withdraws two apples, and proceeds to feed them to his horse, Drusilla. Once Drusilla has finished eating, Rictavio checks his surroundings, forcing any hidden players to succeed on a DC 18 group Dexterity (Stealth) check or be detected.

> [!info]+ **Group Checks**
> See <span class="citation">Group Checks (<em>Player's Handbook</em>, p. 175)</span> for more information on how to use group ability checks.

> [!abstract]+ **Detecting Magic**
> If a player casts _detect magic_ while in Rictavio's presence, they can immediately notice:
> 
> * the aura of illusion magic surrounding his _hat of disguise_,
> * the aura of enchantment magic surrounding his _ring of mind shielding_, and
> * the aura of abjuration magic surrounding his _amulet of proof against detection and location_, which he wears hidden beneath his shirt.

If he detects any players, Rictavio calls out to them and notes, amusedly, that it's impolite to lurk in dark places. He then lightheartedly interrogates them, doing his best to uncover their purpose in following him while avoiding revealing his true identity. 

If asked who the food is for, Rictavio insists that it is for "my friend, the destitute toymaker." (He is referring to Gadof Blinsky, described further in <span class="citation">N7. Blinsky Toys (p. 118)</span>.)

If confronted regarding his magic items or true identity, Rictavio directs the players to check their surroundings for spies, then demands that they prove themselves not to be spies of Strahd. If the players respond persuasively, he then insists that they swear themselves to secrecy. If they do, his story changes as follows:

* If the players do not suspect his true identity, Rictavio "reveals" that he is a secret agent of the Keepers of the Feather, a secret society dedicated to resisting Strahd. (His true name, he claims, is classified, for fear that it may lead Strahd to pursue his loved ones.)
* If the players do suspect his true identity, Rictavio "reveals" that he is Arthur Sedgwick, a  former student of Van Richten from a land beyond the Mists, who followed Dr. Van Richten to Barovia when he heard the vampire hunter had gone missing.

These are lies. A DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check indicates that Rictavio's eyes flicker upwards for a moment before he gives the Keepers' name or Arthur's. If further confronted, Rictavio denies any additional allegations. "Believe what you will," he concedes, shrugging. "What you think is no concern of mine."

Rictavio declines to share further information for fear that Strahd's agents might steal it from them. 

If he fails to detect the players, Rictavio uses his *hat of disguise* to assume the form of a random Vallakian commoner, then slips out of the stable onto the street. He then proceeds to weave through the streets and alleys of Vallaki in a paranoid attempt to lose any followers. A player attempting to follow him must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check or lose him in the crowd. 

> [!abstract]+ **Following Rictavio**
> Once he departs the Blue Water Inn's stable, Rictavio proceeds to Arasek Stockyard, where he slips the parcel of food through the slats of the rear door of his wagon. He then provides Arabelle a brief update on the town's activities as she eats, kneeling before the wagon as described in [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E8b. Following Rictavio|Arc E - The Missing Vistana]].
### Exiting the Inn
As the players depart the Blue Water Inn on their first morning in Vallaki, they find the street full of townsfolk. Assuming the players do not interfere, the following scene then unfolds:

* The players hear the sound of a whinnying horse from down the street—and the townsfolk freeze and fall silent. A small procession lies to the south: Baron Vargas Vallakovich (as described in <span class="citation">Roleplaying the Vallakovich Family, p. 105</span>) riding upon his chestnut horse, flanked by his two **mastiffs** named Claw and Fang, and followed by three **guards**. Izek Strazni leads the procession. 
* The players can see that an old, frightened-looking woman wearing threadbare commoner’s clothes has just stumbled away from the horse and fallen into a puddle of mud a few feet away from the horse. The horse has come to an abrupt halt, and the procession has stopped along with it. Izek’s devilish arm is outstretched, suggesting that he has just pushed—or flung—the old woman into the mud. (The woman is Willemina Rikalova, the mother of the imprisoned shoemaker Udo Lukovich.)
* The Baron angrily scolds the woman for getting mud on his cloak with her “filthy peasant’s hands.” The old woman, her voice quavering, apologizes and pleads with the Baron to release her son, Udo, claiming that he meant no harm with his “foolish joke.” 
* The Baron insists that Udo needs “rehabilitation” for his “malicious unhappiness,” and suggests that the woman does as well. He commands Izek to seize her and lock her in the stocks, suggesting that “a few days in the stocks ought to tighten her tongue.” Izek steps forward, flexing his devilish arm with a cruel glint in his eye. 
* Izek grabs the woman, hauls her to her feet, and thrusts her rudely into the guards’ waiting arms. Two of the guards pull the old woman’s arms behind her back and begin to pull her south as she struggles, weeps, and pleads for her son’s freedom. No townsfolk dare to help her. 
* As the old woman is hauled away, the Baron turns to the townsfolk surrounding him and announces: “Let that be a lesson as to the dangers of malicious unhappiness! The Devil’s hand is long, but our joy shall overcome his shadow.”

If the players interrupt Willemina’s arrest, the Baron greets them as outsiders and asks, with amusement, whether they seek to claim responsibility for the “old fool’s” rehabilitation themselves. 

***Diplomacy.*** If the players make a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check or make an argument that sufficiently flatters the Baron’s ego, he directs the guards to release her into their custody. He welcomes them to Vallaki and pompously commands them to ensure that they educate themselves as to the town’s rules and traditions. 

***Hostility.*** If the players indicate a willingness to start a fight, the Baron’s eyes narrow and his mastiffs begin to growl. Meanwhile, Izek’s arm burns with a crimson flame, his grip tightening around the haft of his silvered battleaxe. 

The Baron first demands to know whether the players are “spies of the Devil Strahd.” The players can attempt to calm the situation and secure Willemina’s arrest peacefully, but any subsequent Charisma checks made to sway the Baron are made with disadvantage.

If it appears that combat is imminent, [[Non-Player Characters#Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian Petrovich]] (as described in <span class="citation">N1. St. Andral's Church, p. 97</span>) steps forth from the crowd and urges peace. The Baron greets him warmly by name, and Father Petrovich apologizes for Willemina’s behavior, noting that she has been troubled in recent days at his congregations. He promises to escort her to St. Andral’s Church and see that her troubled mind is eased—a proposition that the Baron reluctantly accepts.

> [!lore]+ **What's Lucian Doing Here?**
> After discovering [[Act I - Into the Mists/Arc C - Into the Valley|St. Andral's missing bones]] and sending Yeska to recruit Henrik to leave materials to repair the crypt, Father Petrovich sought out Baron Vallakovich in the hopes of obtaining his help in finding the bones. He decided against it, however, after observing the Baron's mood and behavior in the streets. (Lucian doesn't share this unless he's already told the players about the missing bones in [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast]]. He will, however, share that he was hoping to ask the Baron about something, but decided against it after seeing the man's current mood.)

The Baron also wonders aloud whether he should punish the players for their insolence. Father Petrovich assures the Baron that they are merely outsiders, untaught in Vallaki’s ways, and that he shall see to it that they are properly educated. 

The Baron imperiously orders that he see to it, then informs the players that they have caught him “in a good mood,” and that they should be grateful for “the Morninglord’s mercy.” He warns them, however, that future lawbreaking shall be met with harsh punishments.

***Departure.*** As the Baron departs the scene, he announces to the crowd: “I shall expect to see you all at the Festival of the Blazing Sun four days hence. All will be well!”

The townsfolk, bearing smiles that better resemble grimaces, grimly intone, “All will be well.” The Baron nods, evidently satisfied, and continues riding north, followed by Izek, his mastiffs, and any remaining guards. The activity of the street resumes shortly thereafter.

If Ireena is with the party, she has drawn up the hood of her cloak upon exiting the inn. Nonetheless, unless the party has taken specific action to prevent Izek from noticing her, he catches Ireena’s eye and holds her gaze for a long, lingering moment before ultimately departing, leaving Ireena feeling uncomfortable and cold. [[Arc G - The Strazni Siblings]] then begins.

If asked, Ireena notes with uncertainty that something about Izek seemed almost familiar, though she can’t remember why.

If the players defied Vargas or Izek in any way, or otherwise assisted Willemina, Ernst Larnak reports their actions to Lady Fiona Wachter at Wachterhaus. [[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish]] then begins.

***End of an Act.*** When the players set off from the Blue Water Inn for their first full day in Vallaki, **Act I** ends and **Act II** begins.
# Design Notes: Into the Valley
## Journey to Vallaki
***The Lansten Family.*** The encounters with the Barovian scouts and the undead Lansten family have been added to underscore the tragedy of Strahd's siege on the village of Barovia, to introduce Strahd's undead forces, and to foreshadow Strahd's ultimate plan to turn the Barovians into undead to forge his new army upon escaping the Mists.

***Encounter with Strahd.*** Many community encounters with Strahd create situations in which, in order to drive home Strahd's power and cruelty, the players inevitably "lose." Such encounters are likely to frustrate players and engender apathy or despair instead of a tense, yet enjoyable gameplay experience. However, it is equally important that Strahd not be allowed to "lose" his initial encounter with the players, even by proxy (e.g., combat with his minions). To allow Strahd's power to be questioned at this stage would fundamentally undermine his capacity as a villain. 

As such, this encounter intentionally creates a circumstance in which both Strahd and the players can "win" by the end—the players, by convincing Strahd to let them and Ireena go, and Strahd, by gleaning useful information from the players' arguments and by clearly signalling that he is merely humoring their efforts.

While running this scene, recall the wise words of Tywin Lannister: "Any man who must say 'I am the king' is no true king." So too for Strahd: allowing the players to successfully irritate, annoy, or otherwise drive him to "punish them" functionally allows the players to gain a certain measure of control over the conversation, reducing Strahd's appearance of real and apparent control, and indicating that Strahd is a petty noble who cares about his own ego. Always remember that, especially at this stage, the players *cannot hurt* Strahd in any meaningful way—and, as such, he feels no need to hurt *them* in any meaningful way.

Altogether, the intended effect of this encounter is to introduce the players to Strahd, make the players hate and fear him, put the players on notice of Strahd's minions and servants, to reassure the players that Strahd will be an inevitable antagonist, and to make the players appreciate Strahd's Lawful Evil alignment—that, while inhabiting his Gentleman, he will do them no harm until and unless they give him reason to do so.

***The Strix.*** The greater and lesser strix have been introduced to provide Baba Lysaga and the druids of Yester Hill with a meaningful way of combating the wereravens of the Keepers of the Feather. Muriel has also been added here to foreshadow the Keepers of the Feather, to foreshadow Strahd's prophecy (which the players will have an opportunity to learn after defeating the druids at Yester Hill), and to continue setting up Muriel's existence before her formal introduction at the beginning of the winery quest.

***Changes to Lycanthropy.*** Due to the game-breaking impact that a lycanthrope player character can have on your game, it has been intentionally made as difficult as possible to achieve the full benefits of the curse. This version creates clear-cut rules to delineate lycanthropes who have "embraced" their curse and those that have not, and ensures that these rules rely on character-driven storytelling, rather than arbitrary game mechanics. 

Lycanthropic immunity has been changed to silver-based regeneration in order to ensure that lycanthropes resonate with common understandings of lycanthropy and to ensure that all classes can meaningfully contribute to a lycanthrope's defeat, with or without magic weapons or spell. Lycanthropes have also been made weak to necrotic damage (in addition to damage from silvered weapons) in order to provide creative players with an alternate means of halting their regeneration and (more importantly) to explain how Strahd, who owns no silver weapons, is able to keep the werewolves in line.

***The Tarokka Reading.*** Madam Eva's warnings at the beginning of the reading have been added to increase the tension of the reading, to ensure that players treat it with the weight and care that it deserves, and to introduce a minor element of dramatic intrigue in the scenes that follow.

***Arturi Radanavich.*** Arturi Radanavich is a creation of the *Advanced Dungeons & Dragons* sourcebook *Van Richten's Guide to the Vistani.* His tale (and his character) have largely been transplanted directly into this guide in order to further introduce Van Richten's legend (and tragedy), to provide an explanation for Van Richten's transformation into a more sympathetic character, to introduce Ezmerelda d'Avenir, and to create player investment in Van Richten's history upon uncovering his burned journal in Van Richten's Tower.

***The Dancing Fire.*** The Game of Stories has been introduced to provide the players with an opportunity to decompress in a relatively safe location while engaging with and exploring one anothers' histories and interests. The Game itself—along with its wagers—introduces an aspect of dramatic tension to the encounter, ensuring that players remain invested and engaged with each story told. 

Stanimir's tale indicates the relationship between Strahd and the Vistani, thereby foreshadowing Arrigal's loyalty to him. Eliza's tale introduces the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind* and the sympathetic nature of ravens, as well as Baba Zelenna's interference with the Forest Fane at Yester Hill (i.e., by using it to summon Chernovog). Arturi's tale colorfully introduces the tragedy of Dr. Rudolph van Richten, building the suspense for a character that the players will soon have an opportunity to meet. Finally, Ireena's tale foreshadows her relationship to Izek Strazni and her true origins in Vallaki.

***A Gift for Arabelle.*** Madam Eva's request has been added to create a hook to Blinsky Toys in Vallaki (allowing the players to observe Izek's commissioned Ireena-shaped doll) and to the Vistani encampment outside of Vallaki (allowing the players to begin the quest to find the missing Arabelle).

***The Skeletal Rider.*** The encounter with the skeletal rider is a short, but evocative scene that aims to resonate with the themes of undeath, loneliness, and mystery that infuse this arc.

***The Watchtower.*** This short landmark serves to foreshadow the tragedy of the Barovian refugees, the fate of the Order of the Silver Dragon, and the bloodstained history of the valley.

***Tser Falls.*** The encounter with the revenant has been added to provide the players with a clear, though non-urgent hook to Argynvostholt. The revenant's responses are intentionally kept terse in order to ensure that the players learn little of the Order of the Silver Dragon until their meeting with Sir Godfrey Gwilym.

***Meeting Morgantha.*** This scene has been intentionally structured to discourage the players from uncovering Morgantha's true identity, attacking the night hags, or entering Old Bonegrinder. (They will have a full opportunity to do so later in ***Arc I. The Lost Soul***.) Instead, this scene merely introduces Morgantha as a character, foreshadows her domain over dreams, and informs the players that she lives in the old windmill with her two daughters (i.e., her coven).

***The Deep Woods.*** The swarms of ravens have been added to ensure that the players view ravens (and, by extension, wereravens) as friends and allies. Ireena's reaction to Lake Zarovich has been added to further foreshadow her relationship to Izek and her origins in Vallaki.

***The Werewolf's Hunt.*** This brief combat encounter introduces werewolves and provides the swarms of ravens (and Muriel) with an opportunity to assist and defend the players. The wolves' ***Maul*** action option has been added to create a more tense and dynamic combat scenario.
## Welcome to Vallaki
***The Refugee Camp.*** The Barovian refugee camp has been placed here to provide the players with an additional reason to hate Baron Vallakovich and Izek, and to provide Morgantha with a natural constituency for her dream pastries. By rejecting Ireena's efforts to help them, the refugees progress her character arc by allowing her to realize that she cannot help her people so long as Strahd survives, which fuels her ultimate decision to join the party in their fight.

***The Tax.*** The guards' tax gives the players an additional reason to hate Baron Vallakovich. The silver tariff also indicates to the players the wealth of silvered weapons and ammunition that the Baron has hoarded.

***The Blue Water Inn.*** This sequence has been intentionally structured to slowly and manageably introduce the players to several of the key players in Vallaki: the Martikovs, the Wachters, the wolf-hunters, and the ringmaster Rictavio. Rictavio's tale has been written to be as comedic as reasonably possible in order to discourage the players from taking him seriously until the reveal of his identity in [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana]].

***Exiting the Inn.*** The players' encounter with Baron Vallakovich and Izek on the roads of Vallaki has been added to provide the players with an immediate reason to dislike them, to introduce the players to Father Lucian Petrovich, to set up the core dramatic tension of the Baron's tyrannical rule over Vallaki, to kick off Izek's pursuit of Ireena, and to provide Lady Fiona Wachter with an actionable reason to invite the players into her machinations. **It is essential that the players do *not* fight Izek here, and all reasonable precautions have been taken to ensure this.**
