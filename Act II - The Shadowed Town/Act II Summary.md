In this act, the players are left to explore the shadowed town of Vallaki—a Barovian settlement that has found itself embroiled in tension, tragedy, and intrigue in the wake of Strahd's awakening.

As the players seek to complete lingering obligations—obtaining the *Tome of Strahd* in [[Arc D - The Tome of Strahd]], escorting Ireena to St. Andral's Church in [[Arc E - St. Andral's Feast]], and delivering a toy to the Vistani child Arabelle in [[Arc F - The Missing Vistana]]—they'll meet new allies and enemies, including Victor Vallakovich, the son of Baron Vargas Vallakovich; Lady Fiona Wachter, the Baron's rival for power; Father Lucian Petrovich, the priest of St. Andral's Church; Luvash and Arrigal, the leaders of the Vallakian Vistani camp; and Dr. Rudolph van Richten, the veteran vampire hunter and lone survivor of Doru's rebellion.

At St. Andral's Church, the players will be tasked with recovering the stolen bones of St. Andral before the night of St. Andral's Feast in order to sustain the church's hallowed defenses. At the Vallakian Vistani encampment, the players will be asked to find and rescue Arabelle following her mysterious disappearance. And, depending on the location of the *Tome of Strahd*—at the Baron's mansion or in Wachterhaus—the players will be asked to help restore Stella Wachter's missing soul or kill Izek Strazni, the Baron's brutal enforcer.

Soon after the players' arrival in Vallaki, Lady Wachter may invite them to dine with her personally at her family estate, Wachterhaus, seeking to recruit them into a dangerous conspiracy in [[Arc G - Lady Wachter's Wish]]. Meanwhile, Izek Strazni prowls Vallaki's streets for his long-lost sister, Ireena, in [[Arc H - The Strazni Siblings]]. And following a close encounter with the spirit of Erasmus van Richten, the players will be tasked with obtaining a *heartstone* from the night hags of Old Bonegrinder—a mission that ultimately culminates in an ethereal combat with the vengeful ghost of Leo Dilisnya in [[Arc I - The Lost Soul]].

Act II ends when the players reach 5th level. (See [[#Milestones]] below.) However, the players can still complete unresolved arcs from this act even after Act III begins—assuming, of course, that those arcs are still possible to complete.
# Milestones
The players begin this act at 4th level and end it at 5th level, with each player gaining an equal amount of milestone XP when they successfully do any of the following:

* restore the bones of St. Andral (1,250 XP)
* find the missing Arabelle (1,250 XP)
* defeat Izek Strazni (1,250 XP)
* obtain the *Tome of Strahd* (750 XP)
* restore the soul of Stella Wachter (1,750 XP)
* gain entry to the gates of Krezk (750 XP)
# Timeline
Once the players arrive in Vallaki and Act II begins, the timeline of events unfolds as follows.
## Day Zero
Before the players arrive, the ringmaster Rictavio reserves a room at the Blue Water Inn. 

**The players arrive in Vallaki at dusk.**

That night, the church groundskeeper, Milivoj, steals the bones of St. Andral and delivers them to the local coffin-maker, Henrik van der Voort.
## Day One
At dawn, Father Lucian Petrovich discovers the missing bones. Players who bring Ireena to St. Andral's Church after this point begin [[Arc E - St. Andral's Feast]].

Izek Strazni and two **guards** put up posters in the Vallaki Town Square advertising the Festival of the Blazing Sun. Players who bring Ireena to the Town Square at this point in time begin [[Arc H - The Strazni Siblings]] if Izek has not already seen Ireena.

Ireena Kolyana seeks an audience with Baron Vargas Vallakovich in order to obtain aid for the Barovian refugees. She is denied, but learns that the Baron's household has experienced a series of recent hauntings. Players who seek to speak with the Baron about these problems after this point begin [[Arc I - The Lost Soul]].
## Day Two
If the players defied Baron Vallakovich or aided Willemina Rikalova on their first morning in Vallaki, the players receive an invitation left by Ernst Larnak inviting them to dine with Lady Fiona Wachter at Wachterhaus. Players who accept Lady Wachter's invitation at this point begin [[Arc G - Lady Wachter's Wish]].

If Izek Strazni saw Ireena outside of the Blue Water Inn on the players' first morning in Vallaki, he visits the Inn while the players are away—preferably at dusk, during Lady Wachter's dinner—and ransacks it in a search for Ireena. [[Arc H - The Strazni Siblings]] then begins.
## Day Three
If the players accepted Lady Wachter's mission to kill Izek Strazni, Ernst Larnak meets them at the Blue Water Inn with a poisoned bottle of wine and a burlap sack for Izek's head.

That night, if the players completed [[Arc F - The Missing Vistana]] and have not yet begun [[Arc I - The Lost Soul]], the spirit of Erasmus van Richten appears to the players as a **poltergeist** and invites them to meet with Victor Vallakovich.
## Day Four
If the players have not restored the bones of St. Andral to St. Andral's Church, the church's protective wards fail at dawn.

If Baron Vallakovich is still in power, Vallaki observes the Festival of the Blazing Sun in <span class="citation">N8. Town Square (p. 119)</span> at noon as described in <span class="citation">Festival of the Blazing Sun (p. 123)</span>.

At sundown, the parishioners of St. Andral's Church attend a service observing the holiday of St. Andral's Feast. 

If the protective wards of St. Andral's Church have not been restored, Strahd's vampiric bride Volenta Popofsky attacks the church during the service, killing dozens of Vallakians and Baroness Lydia Petrovna. 
## Day Five
If the players failed to prevent Volenta's attack or otherwise defend St. Andral's Church in [[Arc E - St. Andral's Feast]], an angry mob forms outside of Baron Vallakovich's manor. The hunter Szoldar Szoldarovich also finds Milivoj, the church groundskeeper, hanging from a tree outside Vallaki—dead by apparent suicide—and returns his body to his family. 

Shortly after sundown, if the players failed to prevent Volenta's attack or otherwise defend St. Andral's Church in [[Arc E - St. Andral's Feast]], the angry mob assaults the manor, capturing the Baron and lynching him in the town square. Victor Vallakovich escapes, taking shelter in one of the abandoned houses abutting Vallaki's western walls. If he still lives, Izek Strazni also escapes, taking shelter in <span class="citation">Q9. Servants' Quarters (p. 133)</span> in Argynvostholt.
## Day Six
At sundown, the **full moon** rises over Vallaki. (Due to Barovia's strange cosmology, the next full moon will arrive just two weeks later.)
## Day Seven
If the players have not yet restored Stella Wachter's soul to her body, her spirit vanishes into the Ethereal Plane at dawn, and is reincarnated into a newborn infant in the village of Krezk. If he's still alive, a grieving Victor Vallakovich hears the call of an *amber shard* buried in the cemetery of St. Andral's Church. Upon unearthing it, he travels to the Amber Temple in search of a means of restoring Stella to life.

> [!abstract]+ **Ireena's Diplomacy**
>
> The day after she speaks with the refugees for the first time, Ireena attempts to meet with the Baron, using her noble birth as a means of obtaining his attention. Though she expects to meet with him alone, she welcomes the players' support and assistance if offered.
>
> If Ireena has already encountered or heard of the Baron’s temperament, she is under no illusions as to the difficulty of winning his favor. However, she is determined to do her best to at least try to help her people—and, as a noble, she is no stranger to the realities of negotiation, compromise, and manipulation.
>
> During Ireena’s meeting with the Baron—whether the players are present or not—the Baron dismisses out of hand any suggestion that the refugees be allowed to enter the town. However, he is willing to allow Ireena to come and go from the town into the refugee camp without requiring her to pay the toll at the gates. If the players are present at this meeting and befriend or antagonize the Baron, he responds as described in <span class="citation">Roleplaying the Vallakovich Family (p. 105)</span>.

# Diverging Paths
The town of Vallaki can be a tangled web of assorted paths in the original module. While this guide aims to present it in a more streamlined and predictable manner, DMs may still find the number of possible events, characters, and outcomes to feel overwhelming. To help you digest this act, two of many potential paths have been provided below to guide you in understanding how your players' choices might drive the narrative forward.
## The Zealous Crusaders
In this potential narrative, the players are passionate, quick-moving characters with a penchant for action over thought.
### Day Zero
After reserving rooms at the Blue Water Inn on their first night in Vallaki, the players befriend Karl and Nikolai Wachter and learn of the Wachter family's hatred of the Vallakoviches. 
### Day One
Upon encountering Izek Strazni and Baron Vargas Vallakovich for the first time, the players leap to Willemina Rikalova's defense, nearly inciting an all-out brawl until Father Lucian Petrovich steps in to calm the tension. Their decision to act draws the attention of Lady Fiona Wachter in [[Arc G - Lady Wachter's Wish]]

The players and Ireena accompany Father Petrovich to St. Andral's Church, where they receive the hook for [[Arc E - St. Andral's Feast]]. After investigating and interrogating Milivoj, the players recruit Father Petrovich and travel to the coffin-maker's shop, where they do battle with Volenta Popofsky and recover the stolen bones.

Later that same afternoon, the players visit Blinsky Toys to purchase a toy for Arabelle, followed by the Vistani encampment. There, they learn of [[Arc F - The Missing Vistana]], and accept the signet ring from Kasimir Velikov.

That night, the players break into the Baron's Mansion, hoping to investigate the ring's history—only to be caught by Victor Vallakovich, who leads them to his workroom and informs them of Khazan's tower at Lake Baratok. A chance sighting of Stella Wachter's silhouette in Victor's *spirit mirror* sparks a conversation, and the players begin [[Arc I - The Lost Soul]].
### Day Two
The players receive a dinner invitation from Lady Fiona Wachter at the Blue Water Inn, thereby beginning [[Arc G - Lady Wachter's Wish]]. While waiting for Szoldar and Yevgeni to return, the players visit the Barovian refugee camp outside of Vallaki's walls, meeting the refugee Franz and learning of Morgantha's true **night hag** nature in [[Arc I - The Lost Soul]].

After contriving an excuse to speak with Victor again, the players travel north to Szoldar and Yevgeni's dressing shack to obtain directions to Lake Baratok in [[Arc F - The Missing Vistana]]. The players venture forth on their own, and quickly discover Rictavio's true identity. The players return to Vallaki by evening, confronting Dr. Rudolph van Richten and Arrigal in Arasek Stockyard, where they hear Arabelle's prophecy.

That night, the players dine with Lady Wachter at Wachterhaus, continuing Arc G - Lady Wachter's Wish. Though receptive to her hostility to the Baron, they're suspicious of her loyalty to Strahd, and decline her assassination mission. 

Upon returning to the Blue Water Inn, however, the players find it ransacked by Izek himself—thereby beginning [[Arc H - The Strazni Siblings]]. Enraged, the players return to Wachterhaus and accept Lady Wachter's offer of aid in killing Izek once and for all. Ireena, upon learning of Izek's attack, demands the right to assist them.
### Day Three
The players continue [[Arc G - Lady Wachter's Wish]] when they meet Ernst Larnak in the taproom of the Blue Water Inn, where they receive the poisoned wine for Izek. The players sneak into the Baron's Mansion and persuade Tereska, the Baron's cook, to include the poisoned wine as a "gift" to Izek. The players stalk Izek for the rest of the day, eventually killing him on the shores of Lake Zarovich and delivering his severed head to Lady Wachter. That night, Lady Wachter intimidates Baron Vallakovich into surrendering power.
### Day Four
The players learn of the **night hag** binding ritual from Victor in [[Arc I - The Lost Soul]]. Following Lady Wachter's speech in the town square at the end of Arc G - Lady Wachter's Wish, the players convince her to lower the protective circle around Wachterhaus, allowing Stella Wachter's spirit to manifest there and recruiting Lady Wachter as an ally.

Together with Lady Wachter and her **cult fanatics**, the players set off for Old Bonegrinder. There, they steal the **night hag** coven's contract, allowing Lady Wachter to bind the hags to the Material Plane. The players vanquish the hags and take their heartstones for use in Victor's *etherealness* ritual.
### Day Five
With the full moon—and, in [[Arc I - The Lost Soul]], Victor's *etherealness* ritual—just over twenty-four hours away, the players take a daytrip to the village of Krezk in [[Arc J - The Walls of Krezk]], hoping to pick wolfsbane that Dr. Rudolph van Richten can use to quell the curse of lycanthropy for one among them. 

After receiving Baron Krezkov's quest, the players travel south to the ruins of Berez, where the witch Baba Lysaga scries on Ilya Krezkov in exchange for Baron Krezkov's gift. The players then return to Krezk to pick wolfsbane. Given the proximity of the Abbey of Saint Markovia, the players also ascend to the Abbey's gates, where they meet the Abbot and are informed to return in two days to meet with Ezmerelda d'Avenir, their foretold ally in ***Arc M: Strahd's Enemy***.
### Day Six
The players return to Vallaki and spend a day of downtime exploring the town and acquiring gear. That night, the players join Victor and Lady Wachter to travel to the Ethereal Plane in [[Arc I - The Lost Soul]], where they do battle with the spirit of Leo Dilisnya while Victor restores Stella's soul to her body.
## The Cautious Explorers
In this potential narrative, the players are cautious, soft-spoken characters with a preference for passivity over boldness.
### Day Zero
After reserving rooms at the Blue Water Inn on their first night in Vallaki, the players watch the half-elf Rictavio carefully, viewing him with suspicion.
### Day One
Upon encountering Izek Strazni and Baron Vargas Vallakovich for the first time, the players remain quiet along the sidelines, unwilling to risk their necks for a stranger. 

The players bring Ireena to St. Andral's Church, where Father Petrovich delivers them the hook for [[Arc E - St. Andral's Feast]]. Agreeing that the night of the feast is far in the future, the players, leave Ireena at the church and depart for Blinsky Toys, followed by the Vistani encampment outside of Vallaki, where they begin [[Arc F - The Missing Vistana]].

After accepting the signet ring from Kasimir Velikov, the players visit the Baron's mansion to research its origins. There, Baron Vallakovich agrees to allow them access to his library in exchange for their investigation into a series of paranormal events that have lately plagued the mansion. 

As the players investigate the attic, they meet Victor Vallakovich and the spirit of Stella Wachter, beginning ***Arc I: The Lost Soul.*** The players decide to bargain with the **night hag** coven, rather than fighting the hags, and agree to set off toward Old Bonegrinder after rescuing Arabelle and retrieving St. Andral's bones.

Late that afternoon, the players travel to Szoldar and Yevgeni's dressing shack, where they recruit Szoldar as a guide to Lake Baratok in [[Arc F - The Missing Vistana]]. When they return to the Blue Water Inn, they find that Izek Strazni has ransacked it in search for Ireena.
### Day Two
The players and Szoldar travel west to Lake Baratok, where they uncover Rictavio's true identity. They return to Vallaki and confront Dr. Rudolph van Richten and Arrigal in Arasek Stockyard, where they hear Arabelle's prophecy.

That afternoon, the players return to St. Andral's Church in [[Arc E - St. Andral's Feast]]. After investigating and interrogating Milivoj, the players recruit Father Petrovich and travel to the coffin-maker's shop, where they do battle with Volenta Popofsky and recover the stolen bones.
### Day Three
The players travel to Old Bonegrinder alone, where they attempt to bargain with the **night hag** Morgantha for the loan of her heartstone in [[Arc I - The Lost Soul]]. Because the players are unwilling to pay her price, however, Morgantha dismisses them without a deal. The players attempt to take her heartstone by force, but are easily dispatched by the coven, which locks them in the attic and infects them with cackle fever.

That night, the players escape from Old Bonegrinder and return to Vallaki, where they learn that the Abbot of the Abbey of Saint Markovia in Krezk can cure their cackle fever.
### Day Four
The players set off for the village of Krezk in [[Arc J - The Walls of Krezk]]. After receiving Baron Krezkov's quest, the players travel south to the ruins of Berez, where the witch Baba Lysaga scries on Ilya Krezkov in exchange for Baron Krezkov's gift. 

The players then return to Krezk and ascent to the Abbey of Saint Markovia, where they meet the Abbot. The Abbot heals their cackle fever in exchange for a promise to undertake ***Arc N: Something Borrowed.*** The players are informed that their foretold ally in ***Arc M: Strahd's Enemy***, Ezmerelda d'Avenir, will return to the Abbey in two days.
### Day Five
The players return to Vallaki and find that Ireena has been kidnapped by Izek Strazni in [[Arc H - The Strazni Siblings]]. The players gain entry to the Baron's mansion with Victor's help and do battle with Izek in the corridors of the manor. 

With Ireena freed, the players and Victor discuss the prospect of defeating the **night hag** coven through a binding ritual in [[Arc I - The Lost Soul]]. The players visit Wachterhaus and convince Lady Wachter to lower the protective circle around Wachterhaus, allowing Stella Wachter's spirit to manifest there and recruiting Lady Wachter as an ally.
### Day Six
Together with Lady Wachter and her **cult fanatics**, the players set off for Old Bonegrinder. There, they steal the night hag coven's contract, allowing Lady Wachter to bind the hags to the Material Plane. The players vanquish the hags and take their heartstones for use in Victor's *etherealness* ritual.

That night, the players join Victor and Lady Wachter to travel to the Ethereal Plane, where they do battle with the spirit of Leo Dilisnya while Victor restores Stella's soul to her body.
