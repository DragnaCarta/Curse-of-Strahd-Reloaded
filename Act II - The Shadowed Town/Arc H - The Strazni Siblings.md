_An adventure for five 4th-level characters._

In this arc, shortly after seeing Ireena Kolyana, Izek Strazni realizes that she is—quite literally—the woman of his dreams. 

After learning from his spies that Ireena has most recently resided at the Blue Water Inn, Izek visits the Inn himself in an attempt to uncover her location. If his effort is unsuccessful, he directs the town guard to publish WANTED posters around Vallaki offering a reward for information regarding Ireena’s location.

If the players neither stop Izek nor take extraordinary measures to keep Ireena concealed, Izek finds and kidnaps Ireena two days later, imprisoning her in his room at the Baron’s mansion. Can the players free Ireena from Izek’s clutches—or will they perish in the attempt?
# H1. The Blue Water Inn
## H1a. Izek’s Visit
Just over a day after catching a glimpse of Ireena Kolyana for the first time—either in the street outside of the Blue Water Inn, in Vallaki’s town square, or in some other location—Izek Strazni recognizes her as the woman that he has seen repeatedly in his dreams and becomes determined to find her. 

Izek soon comes to believe that Ireena is a guest at the Blue Water Inn—either because he observed her in the vicinity of the Blue Water Inn on the players’ first morning in Vallaki, or, unless players disguised her upon their entry into Vallaki, because he learned of her recent arrival from the guards at the gates. (If Izek did not see Ireena outside of the Blue Water Inn and the players kept her disguised upon entering Vallaki, Izek learns of Ireena’s location from one of his spies an additional day later, unless the players have taken extraordinary measures to keep her hidden.)

While the players are away—and preferably during the players’ dinner with Lady Fiona Wachter in [[Arc G - Lady Wachter’s Wish]]—Izek visits the Blue Water Inn and demands to know of Ireena’s location, describing her by appearance. Urwin and Danika deny knowledge of her current location and insist that she is not a current guest. Izek demands entry into each room of the inn to search for her, which Urwin and Danika reluctantly allow.

If Ireena is currently staying at the inn, Urwin quietly directs Brom and Bray to retrieve and conceal her in <span class="citation">N2i. Secret Stairs and Hall (p. 101)</span> while he and Danika keep Izek distracted in <span class="citation">N2f. Stable (p. 101)</span>. To keep Izek busy, Danika allows him to search <span class="citation">N2h. Ravens' Loft (p. 101)</span>, allowing him to find the locked chest buried in the hay. Urwin reluctantly complies with Izek's demands to open the chest, and Izek confiscates the 140 ep and 70 pp as "unpaid taxes."

After rummaging through each room of the inn—including Rictavio’s suite—Izek breaks a table, two chairs, and a window in a fit of rage and storms out of the inn.
## H1b. The Players Return
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 5: Area N2c.</em></span>

The next time that the players return to the Blue Water Inn, they find that the inn is closed to non-guests for the evening, with all of its shutters and doors closed to the public. 

The debris from the broken table and chairs have been placed outside by the shed just outside of the inn’s front door, and the glass from the broken window has been swept into a neat pile, though a cold draft is seeping in through the shutters. 

[[Non-Player Characters#Urwin Martikov|Urwin]], who is holding a broom and dustpan as he gathers splinters and shards from the taproom floor, greets the players wearily upon their return. He can provide the players with the following information:

* Izek Strazni, the baron’s enforcer and captain of the guard, visited the Blue Water Inn earlier that day and demanded the location of a woman matching the description of the players’ companion.
* Izek tore apart the inn in an effort to find her, but was ultimately unsuccessful. In the process, he damaged some of the inn’s property and ransacked the inn’s guest rooms. 
* If Izek took the coins from the Martikovs’ locked chest, Urwin notes that he also took some items with him, but that thankfully no one was harmed. If asked, Urwin dismisses the confiscated coins as “some savings of ours,” but reiterates his relief that Ireena and the players are safe.

Urwin sincerely apologizes to the players for the damage to their rooms, and promises that he and [[Non-Player Characters#Danika Dorakova|Danika]] are working hard to ensure that they will be cleaned up and ready for the players to sleep in that night.

If the players indicate an interest in attacking Izek for his transgressions or to stop him from finding Ireena, Urwin warns them that Izek is a powerful and dangerous foe, protected by the town guard at nearly all hours of the day. Should the players challenge him outright, it shall surely be suicide. 

If the players appear dead-set on challenging Izek, Urwin reluctantly advises them to seek the counsel of Lady Fiona Wachter, who is known to be a steadfast enemy of the Baron. He also offers to uncover details regarding Izek’s schedule and activities in order to assist the players’ efforts. 

Urwin declines to reveal his sources, but notes only that some “friends” of his are adept at finding information without being detected.
## H1c. Ireena’s Aftermath
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 5: Area N2e.</em></span>

If [[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] was at the inn when Izek arrived, [[Non-Player Characters#Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] further informs the players that [[Non-Player Characters#Danika Dorakova|Danika]] is comforting her in <span class="citation">N2e. Kitchen (p. 101)</span> while brewing a batch of hot mulled wine to steady her nerves. (Brom and Bray have been sent to their room for the night—not as a punishment, but to keep them safe should Izek return. Urwin has promised both new toys as a reward for their selflessness and bravery.)

Ireena is shaken, confused, and disturbed by Izek’s visit, but deeply grateful to the Martikovs for their efforts to keep her from harm. (If asked, she can inform the players of the existence of the inn’s secret corridor and staircase, but asks them to promise to keep the Martikovs’ secrets safe.) 

If Ireena was at St. Andral's Church when Izek visited the inn, she visits the inn the following morning and sees the aftermath herself.

***Ireena's Choice.*** Whether Ireena was at the inn or church during Izek's attack, she is filled with guilt, rage, and frustration upon learning of it. With a tremble in her voice, she demands that the players allow her to accompany them should they decide to put a stop to Izek's rampage. Ireena doesn't care about Izek's motivation; she simply wants others to stop suffering for their decisions to protect her.

> [!abstract]+ **Urwin's Aid**
>
> If the players request Urwin’s aid in tracking Izek, Urwin meets them in the taproom the following morning to share the following information, though he politely declines to reveal his sources:
> 
> - Izek is accompanied for most of the day by two Vallakian **guards**. The guards keep a close eye on his surroundings, making it difficult to ambush him. However, Izek usually dismisses the guards and retires to one of several preferred haunts to drink around dusk.
> - Izek’s day-to-day schedule varies, but he reliably takes his midday meal in Vallaki’s town square, delivered by the Baron’s cook. He returns every night to Baron Vallakovich’s mansion to sleep.
> - Strange figures have been seen going in and out of Wachterhaus, the home of Lady Fiona Wachter, one of the Baron’s fiercest political enemies. Rumor has it that one of her servants has been shadowing Izek around town for the past two weeks. She might have aid to offer.
> 
> If the players journey to Lady Wachter’s estate to seek her assistance, they begin [[Arc G - Lady Wachter’s Wish]].

# H2. The Streets of Vallaki
One day after his visit to the Blue Water Inn, Izek directs the town guards to begin publishing posters requesting information regarding the location of a woman matching Ireena’s description. Each poster includes a sketch that roughly matches Ireena’s appearance and offers a reward of five gold pieces for information delivered to Izek Strazni at the Baron’s mansion.
# H3. The Kidnapping
One day after Izek’s posters are published around Vallaki, unless the players have taken sufficient precautions to ensure that Ireena remains completely concealed from the public, a Vallakian delivers a tip to the Burgomaster’s mansion regarding her current location. 

The next time that Ireena and the players are apart, [[Non-Player Characters#Izek Strazni|Izek]], joined by four **guards**, breaks into Ireena’s current location and attempts to kidnap her. [[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] bites off his left ear in the process, permanently giving him disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks involving hearing.

* ***Blue Water Inn.*** If Ireena is still at the Blue Water Inn, [[Non-Player Characters#Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Non-Player Characters#Danika Dorakova|Danika]], alerted by a **wereraven** about Izek’s approach, swiftly move once to hide her in the hidden staircase. However, Izek notices a strand of Ireena’s hair caught in the secret door and forces the door open, finding her. As he hauls Ireena away, he commands the guards to place Urwin in the town stocks. He uses his ***hurl flame*** ability to set fire to the Blue Water Inn, causing severe property damage before Danika and six **wereraven** members of the Keepers of the Feather are able to extinguish it using water from the inn’s well.
* ***St. Andral’s Church.*** If Ireena has been moved to St. Andral’s Church, Izek interrupts [[Non-Player Characters#Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Petrovich]] in the middle of a sermon and demands to know Ireena’s location. Despite Father Petrovich’s protests, Izek finds Ireena in the priest’s office (which Father Petrovich and Yeska have converted into a makeshift third bedroom) and seizes her. Izek coldly vows that he will return to punish the church for hiding Ireena from him, but departs without causing further harm.

If Izek is successful, he then takes Ireena by force to his room in the Baron’s mansion (described in **N3j. Izek's Bedroom**, p. 107), where he binds her with rope, gags her, and places her on his bed. He then takes a chair and several bottles of wine from the first floor, places the chair in his room beside the bed, and remains there until the day of the Festival of the Blazing Sun.

> [!lore]+ **Izek's Sacrifice**
> Shortly after Izek brings Ireena to the mansion, Ireena demands to know the reason for her kidnapping. If Ireena is unaware of her relationship to Izek, Izek then reveals it; otherwise, Izek demands to know why she kept away from him despite knowing.
> 
> In either case, Ireena is disturbed by the depth of Izek's psychopathy and obsession, and her loyalty to her adoptive family and village anger Izek, who deems her a "fake" sent to deceive him. Spiraling into madness, Izek decides that he must sacrifice Ireena in flames to bring his "real" sister back to him. 
> 
> At dawn on the morning of the Festival of the Blazing Sun, Izek removes the offerings to the Morninglord—incense, salted meats, wooden carvings, and jewelry—from the hollow interior of the wicker sun, dumps them on the floor of his bedroom, and secretly replaces them with a bound and gagged Ireena. Izek then insists on personally guarding and escorting the wicker sun to the Festival. 
> 
> If the players fail to rescue Ireena, the wicker sun is brought to the town square at nine o'clock in the morning, and burned at noon at the height of the "festivities," killing Ireena.

# H4. The Rescue
The players can rescue Ireena from Izek’s clutches by first gaining access to his bedroom in the Baron’s mansion. They can do so by infiltrating the mansion or openly storming it.

In either case, if the players are found in a place where they’re not supposed to be, an occupant of the mansion can raise the alarm by shouting for aid. If the alarm is raised, twelve **guards** arrive at the mansion two minutes later. 

The NPCs in the mansion ordinarily behave as follows:

* Baron Vallakovich can generally be found in <span class="citation">N3l. Library (p. 107)</span> during the day, and in <span class="citation">N3o. Master Bedroom (p. 108)</span> at night. He is accompanied by his two **mastiffs**, Fang and Claw, at all times. If he finds the players trespassing, he sets Fang and Claw to attack them, but raises the alarm if the dogs are defeated.
* Baroness Lydia Petrovna can generally be found in <span class="citation">N3c. Dining Room (p. 106)</span> during the day and in <span class="citation">N3o. Master Bedroom (p. 108)</span> at night. If she finds the players trespassing during the day, she assumes that they are guests of her husband, Vargas, and greets them accordingly; otherwise, she screams, then faints. 
* [[Non-Player Characters#Victor Vallakovich|Victor Vallakovich]] can generally be found in <span class="citation">N3t. Victor's Workroom (p. 109)</span> both day and night. If he finds the players trespassing, he greets them warily and demands to know their names and business. (He won’t raise the alarm if his curiosity is satisfied.)
* Tereska, the cook, can generally be found in <span class="citation">N3g. Kitchen (p. 106)</span> during the day, and in <span class="citation">N3f. Servants' Quarters (p. 106)</span> at night. If she finds the players trespassing, she raises the alarm unless they agree to leave.
* Clavdia, the maid, can generally be found on the second floor during the morning, on the first floor during the afternoon, and in <span class="citation">N3f. Servants’ Quarters (p. 106)</span> at night. If she finds the players trespassing, she immediately raises the alarm.

[[Non-Player Characters#Izek Strazni|Izek]] remains in his bedroom with Ireena at all times and refuses to allow anyone else to enter, including the Baron and the household staff. If the players loot Izek’s body following his death, they can recover his silvered battleaxe, a pouch containing 35 gp, and an amber shard of Seriach, the Hell Hound Whisperer. (See the **Amber Shard** appendix for more information about amber shards.)

> [!info]+ **Don't Wake Izek**
>
> When the players first arrive at Izek’s bedroom, roll 1d20 to determine if he is asleep, with advantage if it is nighttime. Izek is asleep in his chair on a roll of 15 or higher.
>
> If a player attempts to sneak into the room while Izek is asleep, they find it impossible to reach the bed without passing near Izek’s chair. As they do so, he clumsily wraps a hand around their wrist while snoring, forcing the player to make a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to extricate themselves without awakening him.
>
> If the players free Ireena and move to exit from the room with her, one of the floorboards creaks loudly, briefly stirring Izek from his deep slumber. With his eyes still closed, he drowsily reaches as if to grab for an object in front of him, murmuring, “Ireena.” If handed one of his dolls, he clutches it to his chest and falls back asleep. Otherwise, he awakens on the following round.

> [!info]+ **Fire in the Mansion!**
>
> Izek’s fire-based abilities are likely to set the wooden floors and paneling of the mansion aflame. If they do, apply the following rules:
>
> * Each contiguous collection of ignited squares counts as a single **fire**. On initiative count 20 of each round, for each fire, roll a number of d4s equal to the number of squares in that fire. For each 4 rolled, an additional square adjacent to the fire also ignites (your choice), becoming a part of the fire. Ignited squares can include either floors or walls. (An ignited wall is engulfed with flames on both sides.)
> * When the fire spreads, each creature within its area must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, that creature can immediately move to an adjacent, unoccupied square within 5 feet.
> * A creature that enters the fire or begins its turn there for the first time on a turn takes 1d8 fire damage.
> * All squares within 10 feet of a **fire** are heavily obscured by smoke. A creature other than Izek that starts its turn in the smoke must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be **poisoned** until the start of its next turn. Undead and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.
>
> One minute after the first fires ignite, Victor Vallakovich descends to the battlefield if able and commands all combatants to move behind him. He then casts _cone of cold_ to extinguish all burning squares.

## H4a. Infiltrating the Manor
If the players infiltrate the manor and successfully make their way to Izek’s bedroom, the door is locked as described in <span class="citation">N3j. Izek's Bedroom (p. 107)</span>. If the players attempt to pick the lock and [[Non-Player Characters#Izek Strazni|Izek]] is awake (see ***Don’t Wake Izek*** below), they must also succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) check to do so without alerting him.

> [!warning]+ **Surprising Izek**
> Don't forget that Izek, even if surprised, can still use his reactions after the end of his first turn in combat. See <span class="citation">Surprise (<em>Player's Handbook</em>, p. 189)</span> for more information.

The players will find it difficult to lure Izek from his bedroom while Ireena is present, but can do so with sufficiently creative and provocative efforts—assuming, of course, they roll sufficiently high. Otherwise, Izek draws his silvered battleaxe and fights at the slightest provocation.

During the battle, Izek can break through one of the interior walls of the Baron’s manor by expending 15 feet of his movement. If he does, he takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage.

If conscious, Ireena uses a dagger concealed in her boot to cut herself free from Izek's restraints on her first turn in combat. She then joins the battle on the second round of combat.

<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Izek makes two melee attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Silvered Battleaxe.</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Burning Punch.</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage, and Izek can push the target up to 5 ft. away. On a critical hit, the target must also succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be dazed until the start of Izek’s next turn. (That creature can move or take one action on its turn, not both. It also can’t take a bonus action or a reaction.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Flaming Wave.</em></strong> A wave of flames sweeps out from Izek in a line that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) fire damage. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Flame Burst.</em></strong> Izek slams his battleaxe into the ground, causing a torrent of flames to swirl around him. Each creature within 5 feet must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Explosive Blast.</em></strong> A bright streak flashes from Izek’s clawed hand to a point he chooses within 90 feet and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target that fails the save is also knocked prone. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Izek can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Izek would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hot Pursuit.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Izek propels himself forward with a jet of crackling flames, moving up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. He can then immediately make a <strong><em>burning punch</em></strong> attack against a creature within range.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cinder Sparks.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack, Izek causes the air around him to burst with swirling cinders. The attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) fire damage and be blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Retaliatory Burn (1/round).</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack made with a metal weapon, Izek causes the object to glow red-hot until the start of his next turn. Any creature in physical contact with the weapon immediately takes 4 (1d8) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or drop the weapon if it can. If it doesn’t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of Izek’s next turn.</p>

> [!combat]- **Balancing the Brute**
> Due to the phase mechanic, this is a series of two consecutive **bruising** combat encounters against a party of five 4th-level players and a CR 2 ally (Ireena Kolyana), and will each consume approximately 31% of their total maximum hit points (for a total of 62% of their maximum hit points). For parties of smaller or larger sizes, modify the encounter as follows:
>

## H4b. Storming the Manor
If the players cause a ruckus at the front door or on the first floor of the manor, [[Non-Player Characters#Izek Strazni|Izek]] overhears them and exits his bedroom, bringing his silvered battleaxe in case of battle. He fights at the slightest provocation.
## H4c. Ireena's Gratitude
[[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is deeply disturbed by Izek's obsession with her. If the players inform her that she is Izek's sister, she mourns the child she once must have known, but not the man that he became. She reaffirms that, no matter who believes otherwise, she is and chooses to be Ireena Kolyana—not Ireena Strazni, or anyone else.

***Milestone.*** Rescuing Ireena from Izek's clutches completes a story milestone. When Ireena is escorted to safety, award each player 500 XP, or 1,250 XP instead if Izek was defeated.
# Design Notes: The Strazni Siblings
This arc has been expanded to provide a more explicit "ticking clock" that drives the players into conflict with Izek Strazni, and as an inciting incident that pushes Ireena to journey with the players and take agency in her fight against Strahd.

***The Blue Water Inn.*** Izek's attack on the Blue Water Inn has been added to provide the players with an additional motivation to seek his death—especially if they are mistrustful of Lady Wachter's motives or doubtful of the benefits of removing her obstacles to power. 

Izek's attack also serves to motivate Ireena to join the players in defeating him, developing her character arc as she moves from passivity to agency and laying the foundations for her ultimate decision to journey with the players at the beginning of **Act III: The Devil's Hand.**

Urwin's aid has been added to discourage the players from fighting Izek directly (i.e., in a fair fight), to direct them toward Lady Wachter (and therefore serve as a backup hook to [[Arc G - Lady Wachter's Wish]]), and to foreshadow his involvement with the Keepers of the Feather, who the players will learn more about in [[Arc K - The Missing Gem.]]

***The Kidnapping.*** Izek's kidnapping of Ireena has been implemented as a failsafe penalty if the players decline to take any action to defeat him before this date (which will most likely be on or about the players' fourth full day in Vallaki).

***The Rescue.*** Izek's ability to break through the interior walls of the mansion has been added to create a more dynamic environment in what would otherwise be a cramped, closed-quarters space.
