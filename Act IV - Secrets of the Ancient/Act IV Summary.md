In this act, which begins once the players have lit the beacon of Argynvostholt in [[Arc Q - A Shining Beacon]], the players must journey to the peak of Mt. Ghakis in order to find the long-lost *Sunsword* and uncover the secrets of the Fanes of Barovia. 

Upon recruiting the dusk elf Kasimir Velikov and learning of his interest in the Amber Temple, the players set off along Tsolenka Pass in [[Arc R - Trials of the Mountain]], battling monsters, vengeful foes, and the mountain itself in order to reach their destinations. As they do, they are haunted each night by Strahd von Zarovich, who seeks to torment them with cruel, painful games. 

The players' only respite lies in the hidden Mountain Folk village of Soldav. There, the ancient **storm giant** Burebis shares that only the Ladies Three know how the Fanes may be rescued from Strahd's corruptionâ€”but that the secret to contacting their spirits lies in the depths of the Amber Temple itself.

In [[Arc S - A Sword of Sunlight]], the players delve into the darkness of the Amber Temple, seeking to resist its shadows and corruption long enough to obtain the hidden hilt of the *Sunsword*, which Patrina Velikovna sealed long ago within the amber sarcophagus of the Vampyr. Upon retrieving the hilt and defeating Patrina's wrathful spirit, the players must empower the broken sword by conjuring the spirit of Sergei von Zarovich from the mists.

After learning how to contact the spirits of the Ladies Three from the ghost Exethanter, the players return to Soldav in [[Arc T - The Cavern of Lights]]. There, the spirits of the Weaver and Huntress can share that the three Fanes may be reconsecrated by obtaining the three enchanted gems of the Wizard of Wines winery and reigniting the magic that lies within. 

This act ends when the players descend Mt. Ghakis and return to the valley below.
