# Conditions
***Bloodied.*** The creature has half of its maximum hit points remaining (rounded up) or fewer.

***Dazed.*** The creature can move or take one action on its turn, not both. It also can't take a bonus action or a reaction.

***Hindered.*** The creature is slowed, can use one less reaction per round, and can't use its multiattack. A creature can be hindered multiple times. Each additional time a creature is hindered, it loses an additional reaction (minimum zero). Other effects of being hindered don't stack.

***Slowed.*** The creature must spend 1 extra foot of movement for every foot it moves using its speed, attack rolls against it have advantage, and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.
