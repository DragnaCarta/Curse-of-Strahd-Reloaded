<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (1/day).</em></strong> If Izek fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Izek makes two melee attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Silvered Battleaxe.</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Burning Punch.</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage, and Izek can push the target up to 5 ft. away. On a critical hit, the target must also succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be dazed until the start of Izek’s next turn. (That creature can move or take one action on its turn, not both. It also can’t take a bonus action or a reaction.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Flaming Wave.</em></strong> A wave of flames sweeps out from Izek in a line that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) fire damage. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>

<p><strong><em>Explosive Blast.</em></strong> A bright streak flashes from Izek’s clawed hand to a point he chooses within 90 feet and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 9 (2d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target that fails the save is also knocked prone. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Izek can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hot Pursuit.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Izek propels himself forward with a jet of crackling flames, moving up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. He can then immediately make a burning punch attack against a creature within range.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cinder Sparks.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack, Izek causes the air around him to burst with swirling cinders. The attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) fire damage and be blinded until the start of Izek's next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Retaliatory Burn (1/round).</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack made with a metal weapon, Izek causes the object to glow red-hot until the start of his next turn. Any creature in physical contact with the weapon immediately takes 9 (2d8) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or drop the weapon if it can. If it doesn’t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of Izek’s next turn.</p>

Only Lady Wachter herself appreciates the depth of love she feels for her children—and her shattered sense of faith and hope.

To those he trusts, Father Petrovich is a dedicated and stalwart defender of his community, who nonetheless worries about his ability to keep his congregants safe. Deep down, Father Petrovich harbors a twinge of doubt about the Morninglord's providence and power, wondering if Strahd's awakening is a test of Barovians' faith or a sign that the land is forsaken forever.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Father Petrovich would prefer to dissuade his attackers, surrendering peacefully if necessary to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. However, if an innocent life or the members of his congregation were threatened, he would fight to the death with a prayer on his lips and peace in his heart.

**Character Information**

***Motivations.*** Arrigal wants to protect his family and ensure a bright future for Barovia’s Vistani, free of the resentments of the small-minded Barovians—a goal which he intends to accomplish by serving Strahd.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Arrigal, channel Loki (*Thor*), Littlefinger (*A Game of Thrones*), and Hannibal Lecter (*The Silence of the Lambs*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Arrigal is Luvash’s enforcer and adviser: a cautious, cheerful, and curious man who prefers to remain aloof from the troubles of others. To those he trusts, Arrigal is a dedicated uncle, a fierce advocate for the Vistani, and a duelist with a slew of deadly skills. Only Arrigal knows that he serves Strahd von Zarovich faithfully as one of his spies—and that he would go to great lengths to serve the vampire’s will in exchange for the prosperity of his family and people.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Arrigal would act with ruthless cunning, retreating as necessary before striking from the shadows, using deceit, manipulation, or dirty tricks to ensure an advantage.

***Relationships.*** Arrigal is Luvash’s younger brother and Arabelle’s uncle. He is also a spy for Strahd and makes regular reports to Anastrasya, one of Strahd’s vampiric brides.

## Victor Vallakovich
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Victor should make the players feel annoyed at his suspicion and condescension, sympathetic to his anxiety, frustration, and desperation, and endeared to his stubborn determination to see Stella healed.

***Emotions.*** Victor most often feels curious, frustrated, suspicious, excited, bored, anxious, desperate, or determined.

***Motivations.*** Victor wants to restore Stella’s soul to her body and escape Barovia.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Victor, channel Jonathan Byers (*Stranger Things*), Prince Zuko (*Avatar: The Last Airbender*), Raven (*Teen Titans*), and Perrin Aybara (*Wheel of Time*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Victor is a quiet, moody, and isolated young man with an awkward manner and a total lack of social graces. To those he trusts, Victor is a devoted and compassionate friend, with a spark of brilliance and the stubbornness of a mule. Only Victor knows that he secretly fears losing Stella’s friendship—both due to the harm caused by his *teleportation circle* and due to the time she’s spent with Erasmus van Richten in the Ethereal Plane.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Victor would attempt to flee, but would resort to his most dangerous spells with wanton and amateurish abandon if cornered or if defending his friends or family.

***Relationships.*** Victor is the only child of Baron Vargas Vallakovich and Baroness Lydia Petrovna. He is a close friend to Stella Wachter, and a friendly (though wary) acquaintance to the ghost of Erasmus van Richten. Victor despises and fears Izek Strazni, who killed Victor’s childhood cat, Miska, by kicking it across a room when it wandered into his path two years ago. (Victor has since reanimated Miska’s skeleton through the use of his *animate dead* spell.)
# Castle Ravenloft
## Volenta Popofsky
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Volenta should inspire revulsion with her obsession with pain and gore, discomfort with her sadistic and psychotic personality, and a strange sort of flattery with her flirtatious—if eccentric—attitude.

***Emotions.*** Volenta most often feels amused, curious, irritated, bored, fascinated, enraged, and gleeful.

***Motivations.*** Volenta wants to impress Strahd and earn her place as foremost among his brides, to satisfy her frequent sadistic urges, and to find novel ways to cause suffering and pain through tinkering and innovation.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Volenta, channel Jinx (*Arcane*), Ty Lee (*Avatar: The Last Airbender*), and Harley Quinn (*Batman*).

**Character Information**

***Persona.*** To strangers, Volenta is a manic, impulsive, and trigger-happy sadist with a flair for invention and innovation.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Volenta would gleefully relish the opportunity to test her custom-made weapons on hostile subjects—and, when pushed far enough, to tear those subjects apart with her bare hands and teeth.

***Relationships.*** Volenta is fanatically loyal to Strahd von Zarovich, and views his other brides and consorts—especially Anastrasya, Ludmilla, and Escher—with deep resentment, jealousy, and suspicion.

<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Volenta regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If Volenta takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> Volenta can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight, Volenta takes 20 radiant damage at the start of her turn, and she has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Nimble Escape.</em></strong> Volenta can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of her turns.</p>
<p><strong><em>Awakened Bloodlust.</em></strong> When Volenta drops to 0 hit points, her statistics are instantly replaced by the statistics of her second form. Her initiative count doesn't change.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Volenta uses <strong><em>hail of daggers</em></strong> twice, or uses <strong><em>hail of daggers</em></strong> once and either <strong><em>tanglefoot</em></strong> or <strong><em>thunderstone</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hail of Daggers.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tanglefoot (1/day).</em></strong> Volenta hurls a bag of writhing, sticky black tar at a point on the ground within 30 feet. The bag bursts on impact, covering up to two creatures within 5 feet of one another with sticky tar and forcing each target to succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be restrained. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thunderstone (1/day).</em></strong> Volenta hurls a crystalline shard at a creature, object, or surface within 30 feet. The shard shatters on impact with a blast of concussive energy. Each creature within 10 feet of the point of impact must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed 10 feet away from that point. A creature that fails the save is also deafened until the start of Volenta’s next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alchemist's Firebomb (1/day).</em></strong> Volenta hurls a flask of concentrated alchemist's fire and hurls it at a point within 30 feet. The vial shatters on impact and detonates in a 10-foot radius. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage and be set ablaze. A creature set ablaze in this way takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns, and can make an additional DC 14 Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns to extinguish the flames.</p>

<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Volenta regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If Volenta takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> Volenta can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight, Volenta takes 20 radiant damage at the start of her turn, and she has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Blood Frenzy.</em></strong> Volenta has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Volenta makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by Volenta, incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Volenta regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, Volenta can grapple the target (escape DC 13).</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Leap.</em></strong> Volenta moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks. As she does, she can replace 10 feet of movement with a 10-foot high jump.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Spit Blood.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack, Volenta spits a wad of blood at the attacking creature’s eyes, forcing it to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aggress.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Volenta moves up to her speed toward a hostile creature she can see without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
