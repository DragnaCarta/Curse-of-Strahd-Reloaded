**Character Information**

<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Volenta regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If Volenta takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> Volenta can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight, Volenta takes 20 radiant damage at the start of her turn, and she has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Nimble Escape.</em></strong> Volenta can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of her turns.</p>
<p><strong><em>Awakened Bloodlust.</em></strong> When Volenta drops to 0 hit points, her statistics are instantly replaced by the statistics of her second form. Her initiative count doesn't change. Excess damage doesn't carry over to her new form, but she retains any conditions she had in her previous form.</p>
<div class="break"></div>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Volenta uses <strong><em>hail of daggers</em></strong> twice, <strong><em>dagger</em></strong> twice, or <strong><em>hail of daggers</em></strong> once and either <strong><em>tanglefoot</em></strong> or <strong><em>thunderstone</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hail of Daggers.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, range 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dagger.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em> +7 to hit, 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tanglefoot (1/day).</em></strong> Volenta hurls a bag of writhing, sticky black tar at a point on the ground within 30 feet. The bag bursts on impact, covering up to two creatures within 5 feet of one another with sticky tar and forcing each target to succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be restrained. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thunderstone (1/day).</em></strong> Volenta hurls a crystalline shard at a creature, object, or surface within 30 feet. The shard shatters on impact with a blast of concussive energy. Each creature within 10 feet of the point of impact must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed 10 feet away from that point. A creature that fails the save is also deafened until the start of Volenta’s next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alchemist's Firebomb (1/day).</em></strong> Volenta hurls a flask of concentrated alchemist's fire at a point within 30 feet. The vial shatters on impact and detonates in a 10-foot radius. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage and be set ablaze. A creature set ablaze in this way takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns, and can make an additional DC 14 Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns to extinguish the flames.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by Volenta, incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Volenta regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, Volenta can grapple the target (escape DC 13).</p>

<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Spit Blood.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack, Volenta spits a wad of blood at the attacking creature’s eyes, forcing it to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aggress.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Volenta moves up to her speed toward a hostile creature she can see without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Abscond.</em></strong> In response to escaping a grapple, Volenta uses her <strong><em>leap</em></strong> feature.

On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 cold damage and is restrained by ice until the start of Volenta's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn't restrained. A restrained creature can use its action to make a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Strength check</span> to break free.

<p><strong><em>Final Conflagration.</em></strong> When Volenta is reduced to 0 hit points, she can use her alchemist's firebomb if available, centered on herself. (Any damage taken doesn’t carry over to her second form.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Acrobatic Escape.</em></strong> When an attack misses Volenta, she can use her reaction to move up to half her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Caustic Splash (1/day).</em></strong> When Volenta takes damage from a creature within 5 feet of her, she can use her reaction to splash that creature with caustic chemicals.

    <p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Ludmilla regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or running water. If she takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> Ludmilla can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight, Ludmilla takes 20 radiant damage at the start of her turn, and she has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Form of Mist.</em></strong> When Ludmilla is reduced to 0 hit points, her statistics are instantly replaced by the statistics of her second form. Her initiative count doesn't change. Excess damage doesn't carry over to her new form, but she retains any conditions she had in her previous form.</p>
    <h3>Actions</h3>
    <p><strong><em>Grease.</em></strong> Ludmilla casts <em>grease</em> (DC 15) in a 20-foot-square area.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Command.</em></strong> Ludmilla casts <em>command</em> (DC 15), targeting up to two creatures with the same command. If she is within 10 feet of all targets, she can speak a command of up to three words, rather than one.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Hypnotic Pattern (2/day).</em></strong> Ludmilla casts <em>hypnotic pattern</em> (DC 15).</p>
    <p><strong><em>Dimension Door (1/day).</em></strong> Ludmilla casts <em>dimension door.</em></p>
    <h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
    <p><strong><em>Shroud of Shadows (1/day).</em></strong> Ludmilla summons a shroud of shadows around her, which lasts for 8 hours or until she dismisses it as a bonus action. While the shroud remains, she gains a flying speed of 50 feet (hover) and has resistance to damage dealt by melee attacks. If Ludmilla resists damage in this way, the attacker takes the same amount and type of damage dealt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time Ludmilla takes radiant damage or damage from holy water while the shroud is present, the shroud weakens, reducing her flying speed to 25 feet and causing her to fall 20 feet. The second time Ludmilla takes radiant damage or damage from holy water while the shroud is present, the shroud immediately vanishes.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Entangling Slime.</em></strong> If Ludmilla is currently concentrating on a <em>grease</em> spell, she casts <em>web</em> (DC 15) without using concentration, targeting the same 20-foot-square area as the <em>grease</em> spell. The webs vanish when she loses her concentration on <em>grease.</em></p>
    <h3>Reactions</h3>
    <p>Ludmilla can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If she would lose her reactions and isn't incapacitated, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Misty Step.</em></strong> In response to taking damage, Ludmilla casts <em>misty step.</em></p>
    <p><strong><em>Disrupt Spell (3/day).</em></strong> <em>3rd-Level Spell:</em> 60 feet, components S, instantaneous. <em>Effect:</em> Ludmilla attempts to disrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, it must make a DC 15 saving throw using its spellcasting ability. On a failure, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Mage's Reprisal.</em></strong> In response to being missed by a spell attack or succeeding on a saving throw against a spell, Ludmilla can immediately force the caster to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) force damage.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Contingency (1/day).</em></strong> If Ludmilla would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, a <em>contingency</em> spell activates, allowing her to gain the effects of <em>dimension door</em>. (Because Ludmilla doesn't cast the spell at the time of her reaction, it can't be countered.)</p>

<p><strong><em>Devil’s Sight.</em></strong> Ludmilla can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Ludmilla regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If she takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Ludmilla makes two Shocking Grasp attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shocking Grasp.</em></strong> <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (2d8) lightning damage. On a hit, the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lightning Lance.</em></strong> A bolt of lightning arcs toward a creature of Ludmilla’s choice that she can see within 30 feet. Two bolts then leap from that creature to as many as two other creatures, each of which must be within 10 feet of the first creature. (A creature can be targeted by only one of the bolts.) Each creature must make a <span class="highlight">DC 15 Dexterity saving throw</span>, taking 9 (2d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Shroud of Shadows (1/day).</em></strong> Ludmilla summons a shroud of shadows around her, which lasts for 8 hours or until she dismisses it as a bonus action.

The second time Ludmilla takes radiant damage or damage from holy water while the shroud is present, the shroud immediately vanishes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Duplicate.</em></strong> Ludmilla creates a perfect, intangible illusion of herself that lasts until the start of her next turn. The illusion appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of her. Ludmilla can then magically switch places with the illusion. While the illusion remains, it perfectly mimics Ludmilla's actions, speech, and movement, though it cannot attack. A player can make a <span class="highlight">DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check</span> to determine which Ludmilla is illusory. The illusion vanishes if it takes any damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Freezing Ray.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Spell Attack:</em> +7 to hit, range 120 ft., three creatures. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (2d6) cold damage per ray.</p>
<p><strong><em>Darkness (1/day).</em></strong> Ludmilla casts <em>darkness</em> with a radius of 40 feet.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Ludmilla can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Ludmilla would lose her reactions and isn't incapacitated, she loses one reaction instead..</p>
<p><strong><em>Misty Step.</em></strong> In response to taking damage or casting *darkness*, Ludmilla casts <em>misty step</em>. She can then immediately take the Hide action. If she’s flying, she has advantage on the check made to hide.</p>

<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Ludmilla regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If she takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> Ludmilla can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight, Ludmilla takes 20 radiant damage at the start of her turn, and she has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cold Sensitivity.</em></strong> When Ludmilla takes cold damage, she freezes into a corporeal form until the start of her next turn. While frozen in this way, she loses the attributes of her Mistform feature, loses her immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, gains vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage, loses her immunity to the grappled, prone, and restrained conditions, and loses her fly speed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mistsight.</em></strong> While within fog, Ludmilla has blindsight that extends to the edge of the fog, out to a maximum of 60 feet.
<p><strong><em>Mistform.</em></strong> Ludmilla can enter and occupy the space of another creature, and can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. She can't fall, and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated. However, while making a melee attack or grappling a target, Ludmilla loses these attributes, as well as her immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons and loses her immunity to the grappled, prone, and restrained conditions.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Ludmilla makes two attacks with her claws. She can replace one attack with a mist shards or bite attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage plus 2 (1d4) necrotic damage. Instead of dealing the slashing damage, Ludmilla can grapple the target (escape DC 14).</p>
<p><strong><em>Mist Shards.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Ludmilla regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Dissipate.</em></strong> If Ludmilla is heavily obscured by mist or fog, she takes the Hide action.
<p><strong><em>Asphyxiate.</em></strong> One creature within 30 feet must make a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Constitution saving throw</span>. On a failure, the target's head is surrounded by a vacuum of air for 1 minute, or while Ludmilla maintains her concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). While surrounded by this vacuum, the target is deafened, can't speak, can't breathe (but can hold its breath), and has a number of levels of exhaustion equal to three minus the number of minutes of air it has left (minimum 0). In addition, a target surrounded by this vacuum must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns or lose 1 minute of air on a failure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target loses all levels of exhaustion gained in this way if it falls unconscious or the vacuum disappears. The vacuum disappears if Ludmilla takes the Hide action or if the target is ever behind full cover or more than 30 feet away from her.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Ludmilla can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Ludmilla would lose her reactions and isn't incapacitated, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fog Cloud.</em></strong> In response to taking damage, Ludmilla casts <em>fog cloud</em> without concentration.
<p><strong><em>Poison Mist.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a creature within 5 feet, Ludmilla forces that creature to succeed on a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Constitution saving throw</span> or take 7 (2d6) poison damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ambush.</em></strong> In response to hearing or seeing a creature move within 30 feet while she's hidden, Ludmilla moves up to her speed toward it and attacks it with her claws.</p>

## Anastrasya Karelova
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Anastrasya should inspire flattery for her compliments and charm, suspicion for her disguised efforts to probe for the players’ secrets, and disgust for her apathy toward the plight of the Barovian people.

***Emotions.*** Anastrasya most often feels calm, amused, satisfied, or intrigued.

***Motivations.*** Anastrasya wants to remove Volenta, Ludmilla, and the players as competitors to Strahd’s affections—by setting them against each other, if at all possible.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Anastrasya, channel Lara Raith (*The Dresden Files*), Margaery Tyrell (*Game of Thrones*), and Irene Adler (*Sherlock Holmes*)

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Anastrasya is an empathetic, thoughtful, and charming socialite. To those who know her better, Anastrasya is a cunning, merciless chessmaster with a penchant for worming her way out of even the stickiest situations.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Anastrasya would parlay for peace—and stab her enemy in the back as soon as an opportune moment presented itself.

***Relationships.*** Anastrasya is Strahd’s third-youngest bride and a former Vallakian noble from a now-extinct house.

<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Anastrasya regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If she takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> Anastrasya can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>

<p><strong><em>Skinchange.</em></strong> When Anastrasya is reduced to 0 hit points, her skin sloughs off, revealing a giant, bloated, grotesque bat. Her statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of her second form. Her initiative count doesn’t change. Excess damage doesn't carry over to her new form, but she retains any conditions she had in her previous form.
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Anastrasya makes three attacks with her flying sword, or two with her claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, Anastrasya can grapple the target (escape DC 13).</p>
<p><strong><em>Flying Sword.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Charm.</em></strong> One creature within 10 feet must make a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Wisdom saving throw</span>. On a failure, the target is magically charmed for 1 minute or until Anastrasya loses her concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). A target that can't see Anastrasya automatically succeeds. While charmed, the target regards Anastrasya as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected; it isn't under Anastrasya's control, but takes her requests and actions in the most favorable way and lets Anastrasya bite it. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
<p><strong><em>Telekinetic Thrust.</em></strong> Anastrasya chooses one object weighing 1 to 50 pounds within 30 feet that isn't being worn or carried. The object flies in a straight line up to 30 feet in a direction Anastrasya chooses before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Dexterity saving throw</span>. On a failed save, the object strikes the target and stops moving. When the object strikes something, the object and what it strikes each take 3d8 bludgeoning damage.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Anastrasya can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Anastrasya would lose her reactions and isn't incapacitated, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Night's Retreat.</em></strong> In response to taking damage, Anastrasya can fly up to half her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Call Defender (1/round).</em></strong> In response to being targeted by an attack, if Anastrasya has charmed a creature, she commands that creature to use its reaction, if available, to move up to its speed toward her. If the charmed creature ends its movement within 5 feet of Anastrasya, it becomes the target of the attack instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Telekinetic Defense.</em></strong> In response to being targeted by an attack or spell, Anastrasya telekinetically summons one object weighing 1 to 50 pounds within 30 feet that isn't being worn or carried, gaining half cover against the triggering attack or spell.</p>

<p><strong><em>Horrific Screech.</em></strong> All creatures that can hear within a <span class="highlight">30-foot radius</span> must succeed on a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Constitution saving throw</span> or suffer the following effects: On a failed save, a creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and concentration checks until the start of Anastrasya's next turn. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, it is also frightened of Anastrasya until the start of her next turn. If a creature fails the save by 10 or more, it is also paralyzed until the end of Anastrasya's next turn.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Anastrasya can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Anastrasya would lose her reactions and isn't incapacitated, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wing Attack.</em></strong> When Anastrasya takes damage from a creature within 5 feet of her, she can force the attacker to make a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Strength saving throw</span>. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed back <span class="highlight">10 feet</span>. If they fail the save by 5 or more, they also fall prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vampiric Command.</em></strong> When a creature moves within 10 feet of Anastrasya or damages her while within 10 feet of her, she can use her reaction to force the creature to make a <span class="highlight">DC 14 Wisdom saving throw</span>.

## Escher
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Escher should make the players feel amused and flattered with his flamboyantly flirtatious behavior, irritated with his snide or condescending commentary, and, eventually, sympathetic to his unspoken guilt for his role in bringing harm to his friends and neighbors by awakening Strahd.

***Emotions.*** Escher most often feels annoyed, curious, angry, smug, anxious, fearful, playful, mischievous, amused, guilty, bitter, regretful, or ashamed.

***Motivations.*** Escher wants to please Strahd and avoid falling from his favor.

***Inspirations.*** When roleplaying Escher, channel Asterion (*Baldur's Gate 3*), Crowley (*Good Omens*), and Renly Baratheon (*Game of Thrones*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Escher is a flamboyant and self-assured member of Strahd's court, with a love for preening, luxuries, and attention. Only Escher knows that he is a guilt-ridden, self-loathing, broken man who longs desperately for Strahd's approval and has long since resigned himself to the cage his choices have trapped him in.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Escher would seek to entreat or flee his adversary, fighting only if cornered or if grievously offended.

***Relationships.*** Before becoming one of Strahd's consorts, Escher had a crush on Doru, his former best friend. He is now one of Strahd's consorts—though not formally wed to him—and an inferior member of Strahd's court.
## Sasha Ivliskova
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Sasha should make the players feel sympathetic toward her clear discomfort as one of Strahd's brides, endeared to her for her efforts to maintain her dignity in the face of dismissal and cruelty from Strahd's other brides, and mildly put off by her standoffish reluctance to allow others to get close to her.

***Emotions.*** Sasha most often feels melancholy, anxious, despondent, uncomfortable, anguished, reluctant, or fearful. If treated with kindness, she might feel grateful or hopeful.

***Motivations.*** Sasha is motivated by her desire to avoid Strahd's wrath, protect other vulnerable Barovians from falling under Strahd's thrall, and free herself from the vampiric curse of undeath.

***Inspirations.*** When roleplaying Sasha, channel Sansa Stark (*Game of Thrones)*), Katniss Everdeen (*The Hunger Games*), and Elsa (*Frozen*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Sasha is a quiet, brooding vampire with little interest in others. To those she trusts, Sasha is a sorrowful, guilt-ridden soul desperate to escape her monstrous existence.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Sasha would seek to flee or entreat her adversary, fighting only if cornered by an evil or malevolent opponent.

***Relationships.*** Sasha is Strahd's first bride and a secret friend to Gertruda, Doru's betrothed and Strahd's prisoner.

<p><strong><em>Screams of the Dead.</em></strong> Any creature within 10 feet of Rahadin that isn't protected by a <em>mind blank</em> spell hears in its mind the screams of the thousands of people Rahadin has killed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fey Ancestry.</em></strong> Rahadin has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put him to sleep.</p>
<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (1/day).</em></strong> If Rahadin would fail a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> If Rahadin would be paralyzed or stunned, he is slowed instead. (His speed is halved, he has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and creatures have advantage on attacks made against him.)
<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> Rahadin's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence. He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:<br>
- 3/day: phantom steed<br>
- 1/day: nondetection</p>
<p><strong><em>Mask of the Wild.</em></strong> Rahadin can attempt to hide even when he is only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>
<p><strong><em>Murderous Instinct.</em></strong> When Rahadin drops to 0 hit points, he stows his saber and draws his twin scimitars, <em>Thorn</em> and <em>Chain</em>. His statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of his second form. His initiative count doesn't change. Excess damage doesn't carry over to his new form, and he doesn’t retain any conditions he had in his previous form.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Rahadin makes two attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Saber.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (1d8 + 6) slashing damage, and Rahadin can push the target up to 5 feet away. Instead of pushing the target, Rahadin can force it to succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Poisoned Dart.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (1d4 + 6 plus 2d4) piercing and poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of Rahadin's next turn.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Wind Strike.</em></strong> Rahadin moves up to his speed in a straight line toward an unoccupied space he can see, including through enemy spaces, without provoking opportunity attacks. Each creature within 5 feet of a space he passes through must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Whirling Blades.</em></strong> Each creature within 10 feet of Rahadin must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Rahadin can take up to three reactions per round, though no more than one per turn. If Rahadin would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Punishing Strike.</em></strong> When Rahadin is hit by a melee or ranged attack, he can use his reaction to move up to his speed toward the attacker and make an attack with his saber. This movement doesn't trigger opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Disarm.</em></strong> When an enemy misses Rahadin with a melee attack while wielding a weapon, he can use his reaction to force that enemy to make a DC 19 Strength saving throw, with advantage if the enemy is holding the weapon with two hands. On a failure, the enemy drops the item, which is knocked 10 feet away.</p>
<p><strong><em>Misty Step (1/round).</em></strong> When an enemy misses Rahadin with an attack or deals damage to him, he can use his reaction to cast <em>misty step</em>. He can then immediately take the Hide action. Rahadin doesn't need to see his destination when casting <em>misty step</em> in this way.</p>
<p><strong><em>Psychic Scream (1/day).</em></strong> When Rahadin is reduced to 0 hit points, he can use his reaction to cause his deathly choir to release a terrible scream. Each creature within 60 feet of Rahadin must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) psychic damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also stunned until the start of Rahadin's next turn.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Rahadin makes three attacks with his scimitars <strong><em>Thorn</em></strong> and/or <strong><em>Chain</em></strong>. He can replace one attack with his <strong><em>haunt</em></strong> feature.
<p><strong><em>Thorn.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (1d6 + 6) slashing damage, and Rahadin can force the target to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or bleed for the next 1 minute. (A bleeding target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or take an additional 1d6 slashing damage. On a success or upon receiving magical healing, the target is no longer bleeding.)
<p><strong><em>Chain.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (1d6 + 6) slashing damage, and Rahadin can force the target to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. If the target fails by 5 or more, it also falls prone.
<p><strong><em>Haunt.</em></strong> Rahadin forces a creature he can see within 30 feet to succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage and be frightened and deafened by shrieking souls until the start of his next turn.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Deathly Choir.</em></strong> Each creature within 10 feet of Rahadin that isn't protected by a <em>mind blank</em> spell must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also frightened until the start of Rahadin's next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Swift Step.</em></strong> Rahadin takes the Dash or Disengage action.
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Rahadin can take up to three reactions per round, though no more than one per turn. If Rahadin would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Parry.</em></strong> Rahadin adds +5 to his Armor Class against one melee or ranged attack that would hit him or to the result of a failed Dexterity saving throw, or takes no damage from <em>magic missile</em> this turn. If he causes a melee attack to miss in this way, he can then immediately use an additional reaction, if available, to use his Riposte against the attacker.</p>
<p><strong><em>Riposte.</em></strong> When an enemy misses Rahadin with a melee attack, he can use his reaction to move up to his speed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of that enemy without triggering opportunity attacks. He can then immediately make an attack with <strong><em>Thorn</em></strong> or <strong><em>Chain</em></strong> attack against that enemy with advantage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Amulet of Ravenloft (1/day, Castle Ravenloft only).</em></strong> When Rahadin is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, he can use his reaction to end all effects currently affecting him, and use the <em>Amulet of Ravenloft</em> (see below). If he was reduced to 0 hit points, he drops to 1 hit point instead and suffers an internal injury as described in <span class="citation">Lingering Injuries (Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 272)</span>. He can then move up to his speed without triggering opportunity attacks.</p>

## St. Andral's Church
### Father Lucian Petrovich
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Father Petrovich should inspire gratitude with his hospitality, flattery with his willingness to listen and empathize, comfort with his warmth, serenity, and wisdom, and sympathy for his anxiety regarding the missing bones and the safety of his congregation.

***Emotions.*** Father Petrovich’s most frequent emotions are thoughtfulness, hopefulness, concern, and compassion.

***Motivations.*** Father Petrovich wants to keep Vallaki's spirits up, to keep the church a place of sanctuary and comfort, and to raise Yeska as best as he can.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Father Petrovich, channel Uncle Iroh (*Avatar: The Last Airbender*), Michael Carpenter and Father Forthill (*The Dresden Files*), and Mr. Rogers (*Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To strangers, Father Petrovich is a serene, humble, and compassionate priest who is always happy to share a word of praise or a few pearls of wisdom. To those he trusts, Father Petrovich is a dedicated and stalwart defender of his community, who nonetheless worries about his ability to keep his congregants safe. Deep down, Father Petrovich harbors a twinge of doubt about the Morninglord's providence and power, wondering if Strahd's awakening is a test of Barovians' faith or a sign that the land is forsaken forever.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Father Petrovich would prefer to dissuade his attackers, surrendering peacefully if necessary to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. However, if an innocent life or the members of his congregation were threatened, he would fight to the death with a prayer on his lips and peace in his heart.

***Relationships.*** Father Petrovich is a mentor and father figure to the orphan and altar boy Yeska, the employer of the groundskeeper Milivoj, the brother of Baroness Lydia Petrovna, and the distant descendant of Tasha Petrovna, an ancient cleric of the Morninglord whose remains are kept in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft.
### Milivoj
**Roleplaying Information**

***Motivations.*** Milivoj wants to provide for himself and his siblings.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Milivoj, channel Katniss Everdeen (*The Hunger Games*), Arya Stark (*Game of Thrones*), and Carl Fredericksen (*Up*).

**Character Information**

***Morale.*** In a fight, Milivoj would brandish his shovel in an attempt to get his attacker to back down, but would quickly surrender if seriously wounded. (If defending his siblings, however, Milivoj would fiercely and gladly fight to the death.)

***Relationships.*** Milivoj is employed by Father Lucian Petrovich, secretly works for the coffin maker Henrik van der Voort, and is the eldest of nine children belonging to Oleg and Jarzinka, two dream pastry-addicted Vallakians.

***Resonance.*** Vargas should inspire frustration with his obstinance, disgust for his narcissistic arrogance, and mild amusement for his utter and ridiculous self-assurance.

***Emotions.*** Vargas most often feels annoyed, offended, satisfied, outraged, impatient, or smug.

***Motivations.*** Vargas wants to secure his power free from Strahd's influence and lead Vallaki to escape the Mists by forcing everyone in the town to be happy.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Vargas, channel Lord Farquaad (Shrek), Joffrey Baratheon (Game of Thrones), and Governor Ratcliffe (Pocahontas).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Vargas is an entitled, narcissistic, blue-blooded noble with a bad temper, delusions of salvation, and a love for praise and adoration.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Vargas would command his dogs, Claw and Fang, as well as Izek Strazni and any present guards to seize any who oppose him. If deprived of his defenders, Vargas would either attempt to flee, or—if flight were obstructed—grovel pathetically at the feet of his attacker, begging for mercy.

***Relationships.*** Vargas, the burgomaster of Vallaki, is the father of Victor Vallakovich, the husband of Baroness Lydia Petrovna, the brother-in-law of Father Lucian Petrovich, and the son of the late Baron Valentin Vallakovich. He is also the employer and adoptive "father" of Izek Strazni, his captain of the guard and chief enforcer.
### Izek Strazni
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Izek should inspire disgust with his cruelty and indifference to human life, and discomfort with his unnerving interest in Ireena Kolyana.

***Emotions.*** Izek most often feels irritated, enraged, impatient, sadistic, obsessed, or bored.

***Motivations.*** Izek wants to serve the Baron faithfully—and, far more importantly, find and possess the woman he's been dreaming of.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Izek, channel Ser Gregor Clegane (Game of Thrones), Fenrir Greyback (Harry Potter), and Kratos (God of War).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Izek is a cruel and brutish enforcer with a love for fire and blood.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Izek would gladly draw his silvered battleaxe and fight to the death.

***Relationships.*** Izek is the adoptive "son" of Baron Vargas Vallakovich, the captain of Vallaki's town guard, a frequent customer of the toymaker Gadof Blinsky, and (unbeknownst to either of them) the biological brother of Ireena Kolyana.

<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (1/day).</em></strong> If Izek fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> If Izek would be paralyzed or stunned, he is slowed instead. (He must spend 1 extra foot of movement for every foot he moves using his speed, attack rolls against him have advantage, and he has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.)
<p><strong><em>Second Phase.</em></strong> When Izek is reduced to 0 hit points, his arms and axe are engulfed in flames, the barbs on his fiendish arm grow longer and sharper, and his skin grows red and begins to smoke. His statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of his second form. His initiative count doesn’t change. Excess damage doesn't carry over to his new form, but he retains any conditions he had in his previous form.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Izek makes two attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Silvered Battleaxe.</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage and Izek can push the target up to 5 ft. away.</p>
<p><strong><em>Flame Hurl.</em></strong> <em>Ranged spell attack:</em> +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (2d6) fire damage.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Slicing Whirl.</em></strong> Izek whirls his battleaxe around him. Each creature within a 5-foot radius must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (2d4) slashing damage and fall prone. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage and doesn’t fall prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Flame Volley.</em></strong> Izek conjures a volley of fiery orbs that rain down on a point within 60 ft. that he can see. Each creature within 10 ft. of that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Izek can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Izek would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Forceful Retreat.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack, Izek makes a shove attack against the attacker. He can then immediately move up to 15 ft. away from the attacker without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vengeful Strike.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Izek can move up to 15 ft. toward the attacker without provoking opportunity attacks. He can then immediately make an attack against that creature with his battleaxe.</p>

<p><strong><em>Silvered Battleaxe.</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Burning Punch.</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage, and Izek can push the target up to 5 ft. away. On a critical hit, the target must also succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be dazed until the start of Izek’s next turn. (That creature can move or take one action on its turn, not both. It also can’t take a bonus action or a reaction.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Flaming Wave.</em></strong> A wave of flames sweeps out from Izek in a line that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) fire damage. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Flame Burst.</em></strong> Izek slams his battleaxe into the ground, causing a torrent of flames to swirl around him. Each creature within 5 feet must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Explosive Blast.</em></strong> A bright streak flashes from Izek’s clawed hand to a point he chooses within 90 feet and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target that fails the save is also knocked prone. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Izek can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Izek would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hot Pursuit.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Izek propels himself forward with a jet of crackling flames, moving up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. He can then immediately make a <strong><em>burning punch</em></strong> attack against a creature within range.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cinder Sparks.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack, Izek causes the air around him to burst with swirling cinders. The attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) fire damage and be blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Retaliatory Burn (1/round).</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack made with a metal weapon, Izek causes the object to glow red-hot until the start of his next turn. Any creature in physical contact with the weapon immediately takes 4 (1d8) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or drop the weapon if it can. If it doesn’t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of Izek’s next turn.</p>
</div>

### Victor Vallakovich
Victor’s spellbook contains the _sending_ and _fear_ spells and does not contain _remove curse._

**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Victor should make the players feel annoyed at his suspicion and condescension, sympathetic to his anxiety, frustration, and desperation, and endeared to his stubborn determination to see Stella healed.

***Emotions.*** Victor most often feels curious, frustrated, suspicious, excited, bored, anxious, desperate, or determined.

***Motivations.*** Victor wants to restore Stella’s soul to her body and escape Barovia.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Victor, channel Jonathan Byers (*Stranger Things*), Prince Zuko (*Avatar: The Last Airbender*), Raven (*Teen Titans*), and Perrin Aybara (*Wheel of Time*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Victor is a quiet, moody, and isolated young man with an awkward manner and a total lack of social graces. To those he trusts, Victor is a devoted and compassionate friend, with a spark of brilliance and the stubbornness of a mule. Only Victor knows that he secretly fears losing Stella’s friendship—both due to the harm caused by his *teleportation circle* and due to the time she’s spent with Erasmus van Richten in the Ethereal Plane.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Victor would attempt to flee, but would resort to his most dangerous spells with wanton and amateurish abandon if cornered or if defending his friends or family.

***Relationships.*** Victor is the only child of Baron Vargas Vallakovich and Baroness Lydia Petrovna. He is a close friend to Stella Wachter, and a friendly (though wary) acquaintance to the ghost of Erasmus van Richten. Victor despises and fears Izek Strazni, who killed Victor’s childhood cat, Murka, by kicking it across a room when it wandered into his path two years ago. (Victor has since reanimated Murka’s skeleton through the use of his *animate dead* spell.)

## Blinsky Toys
### Gadof Blinsky
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Blinsky should inspire amusement with his accent, attire, and morbid aesthetic, endearment for his loneliness and sincerity, and sympathy for his terror of Izek.

***Emotions.*** Blinsky most often feels cheerful, frightened, anxious, lonely, joyful, or melancholy.

***Motivations.*** Blinsky wants to use his macabre toys to bring joy to Barovia’s children and to succeed Fritz von Weerg as the greatest toymaker of history.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Blinsky, channel Olaf (*Frozen*), Rubeus Hagrid (*Harry Potter*), and Gepetto (*Pinocchio*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Gadof Blinsky is a cheerful toymaker with a love for the macabre. To those he trusts, Blinsky is a lonely and anxious man, fearful that his work will never be good enough to win his customers’ love.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Blinsky would plead for peace, stumbling over himself and babbling for mercy while looking for an opportunity to flee.

***Relationships.*** Blinsky owns Piccolo, a pet monkey that was given to him by Rictavio, the traveling ringmaster. Blinsky also makes dolls resembling Ireena Kolyana for Izek Strazni, and receives a humble stipend to craft decorations for Baron Vallakovich’s weekly festivals.
## Vistani Encampment
### Luvash
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Luvash should make the players feel sympathetic to his grief, endeared to his dedication to his daughter, irritated with his stubbornness, and mildly uncomfortable with his hot temper.

***Emotions.*** Luvash most often feels angered, melancholy, anxious, guilty, desperate, frustrated, joyful, content, amused, or grateful.

***Motivations.*** Luvash wants to ensure that his daughter, Arabelle, is safe and loved, and that the families of the Vistani encampment can thrive and prosper.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Luvash, channel Boromir (*The Lord of the Rings*), Robert Baratheon (*A Game of Thrones*), Bob Parr (*The Incredibles*), and Wolverine (*X-Men*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Luvash is a gruff, stubborn brawler with an impatient spirit and a heart of gold. To those he trusts, Luvash is a fiercely devoted father with a soft and gentle compassion—but near-overwhelmed by anxiety for the safety of his daughter.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Luvash would draw his blade to protect his people without a moment’s hesitation, but would swiftly sheathe it if necessary to keep Arabelle safe.

***Relationships.*** Luvash is the elder brother of Arrigal, one of Strahd’s spies. (Luvash doesn’t know that Arrigal is a spy for Strahd.) Luvash is also the father of Arabelle, whose mother was one of Madam Eva’s descendants, and—along with Arrigal—one of the two leaders of the Vistani camp outside of Vallaki.
### Arrigal
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Arrigal should make the players feel insulted by his slight condescension, unnerved by his intense curiosity and veneer of cheerful courtesy, and—when they learn of it—both disgusted by and sympathetic to his decision to serve Strahd.

***Emotions.*** Arrigal most often feels curious, suspicious, frustrated, resentful, relaxed, or amused.

***Motivations.*** Arrigal wants to protect his family and ensure a bright future for Barovia’s Vistani, free of the resentments of the small-minded Barovians—a goal which he intends to accomplish by serving Strahd.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Arrigal, channel Loki (*Thor*), Littlefinger (*A Game of Thrones*), and Hannibal Lecter (*The Silence of the Lambs*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Arrigal is Luvash’s enforcer and adviser: a cautious, cheerful, and curious man who prefers to remain aloof from the troubles of others. To those he trusts, Arrigal is a dedicated uncle, a fierce advocate for the Vistani, and a duelist with a slew of deadly skills. Only Arrigal knows that he serves Strahd von Zarovich faithfully as one of his spies—and that he would go to great lengths to serve the vampire’s will in exchange for the prosperity of his family and people.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Arrigal would act with ruthless cunning, retreating as necessary before striking from the shadows, using deceit, manipulation, or dirty tricks to ensure an advantage.

***Relationships.*** Arrigal is Luvash’s younger brother and Arabelle’s uncle. He is also a spy for Strahd and makes regular reports to Anastrasya, one of Strahd’s vampiric brides.
### Kasimir Velikov

**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Kasimir should make the players feel grateful for his competence and genuine interest in assisting them, mildly insulted by his slight condescension, mildly suspicious of his caginess, and sympathetic to his sorrow for the plight of his people.

***Emotions.*** Kasimir most often feels curious, frustrated, suspicious, excited, melancholy, nostalgic, somber, or regretful.

***Motivations.*** Kasimir wants to ensure the safety of the dusk elves and resurrect his sister, Patrina, once he’s freed her of Strahd’s dark influence and seen Strahd destroyed.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Kasimir, channel Stephen Strange (*Doctor Strange*), Sherlock Holmes (*Sherlock*), Spock (*Star Trek*), and the Twelfth Doctor (*Doctor Who*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Kasimir is a quiet and withdrawn scholar, with a powerful curiosity and a fierce dedication to his people. To those he trusts, Kasimir is a lost and broken man, guilt-ridden for his role in Patrina’s death and resigned to somber despair for the dusk elves’ future. Only Kasimir knows the lengths to which he is willing to go to resurrect his sister—and the price he is willing to pay.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Kasimir would attempt to negotiate a peace, but would not hesitate to unleash his most powerful spells—or use his magic to escape—if a diplomatic solution proved untenable.

***Relationships.*** Kasimir is the leader of the dusk elf encampment and the younger brother of the late Patrina Velikovna, a **banshee** who resides in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft. Kasimir is also the cousin of Rahadin, Strahd’s chamberlain, and the nephew of the late dusk elf prince, Erevan Löwenhart. (Kasimir is not a direct blood relation of Erevan, who married Kasimir’s aunt, Lorelei.)
## Wachterhaus
### Lady Fiona Wachter
Lady Wachter still has the statistics of a **priest**. However, she has a different list of prepared spells:

* Cantrips (at will): _light, toll the dead, thaumaturgy_ 
* 1st level (4 slots): _command, sanctuary, bane_ 
* 2nd level (3 slots): _blindness/deafness, zone of truth, hold person_ 
* 3rd level (2 slots): _animate dead, spirit guardians_

**Roleplaying Information**

***Emotions.*** Lady Wachter most often feels concerned, apprehensive, irate, melancholic, satisfied, thoughtful, determined, stern, or (with her children) compassionate and loving.

***Motivations.*** Lady Wachter wants to keep Vallaki—and especially her children—safe from harm. To that end, she hopes to see Baron Vargas Vallakovich removed from power and to reassure Strahd von Zarovich that Vallaki is no danger to his rule.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Lady Wachter, channel Moiraine Damodred (The Wheel of Time), Olenna Tyrell (Game of Thrones), Minerva McGonagall (Harry Potter), and Lady Jessica (Dune).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Lady Wachter is a cold, cunning, and cordial noblewoman. To those she trusts, Lady Wachter is a melancholic, wry, yet fiercely determined advocate for what she sees as the good of Vallaki. Only Lady Wachter herself appreciates the depth of love she feels for her children—and her shattered sense of faith and hope.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Lady Wachter would attempt to negotiate or flee, seeking any means necessary to quell hostilities, up to and including outright surrender. If necessary to save her life or those of her children, however, she would fight to the death with bitter ferocity.

***Relationships.*** Lady Wachter is the widow of the deceased Nikolai Wachter I, and the mother of Nikolai Wachter II, Karl Wachter, and Stella Wachter. She is the employer of the **spy** Ernst Larnak, and an outspoken critic of Baron Vargas Vallakovich.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Dmitri would act only to protect himself or his loved ones, beginning by warning his opponent to stand down, then fighting fiercely until his opponent yielded or was defeated.

***Relationships.*** Dmitri, a secret **werewolf**, is the husband of Baroness Anna Krezkova, the brother of the **werewolf** cleric of Mother Night Zuleika Toranescu, the father of Kala and Ilya Krezkov, and the burgomaster of the village of Krezk.

***Emotions.*** Ezmerelda most often feels determined, thoughtful, skeptical, proud, enthusiastic, angry, amused, wary, or cautious.

***Motivations.*** Ezmerelda wants to save innocents from things that go "bump!" in the night, escape her parents' dark legacy, and prove herself as capable a vampire hunter as Dr. Van Richten.

***Inspirations.*** The Tenth Doctor (*Doctor Who*), Captain Jack Harkness (*Doctor Who*), Buffy Summers (*Buffy the Vampire Slayer*), Malcolm Reynolds (*Firefly*)

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Ezmerelda is a cool, suave, professional monster hunter. To those she trusts, Ezmerelda is a fiery, wise-cracking, and eternally loyal friend. Deep down, Ezmerelda wonders if Dr. Van Richten thought she wasn't good enough—or if her family's crimes against him are enough to stain her legacy forever.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Ezmerelda would move swiftly and tactically to secure an insurmountable advantage, then strike when the moment was right.

***Relationships.*** Ezmerelda is the former student of Dr. Rudolph van Richten, and the daughter of the d'Avenirs who kidnapped and sold his son, Erasmus, to the vampire Baron Metus.

## The Abbot
### Before Redemption
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** The Abbot should inspire discomfort with his stoicism and routine observations regarding "mortals," disgust for his lack of respect for human life or values, anger for his supreme and unshakeable self-confidence, and gratitude for his (somewhat off-putting) friendliness and willingness to cure the players of lycanthropy without cost.

***Emotions.*** The Abbot most often feels curious, intrigued, cold, dispassionate, or (rarely) enraged.

***Motivations.*** The Abbot wants to lift the "curse" upon Barovia and preserve the "sanctity" of the Abbey of Saint Markovia.

***Inspirations.*** When playing the Abbot, channel Vision (*Marvel*), Data (*Star Trek*), and Dr. Manhattan (*Watchmen*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, the Abbot is a serene, but inhumanly dispassionate holy man and "scientist." Only the Abbot knows that he is Ithuriel: an angel of the Morninglord sent to honor the memory of Saint Markovia.

***Morale.*** In a fight, the Abbot would reveal his divine form, then command his enemies to lay down their weapons and surrender. If they failed to do so, he would attack them mercilessly, seeking to crush any resistance until and unless they surrendered or fled.

***Relationships.*** The Abbot, an angel of the Morninglord once called Ithuriel, is the master of the Abbey of Saint Markovia, including the **mongrelfolk** Otto, Zygfrek, and Clovin Belview. He is also the creator of the **flesh golem** Vasilka and the resurrector of Kala Krezkova.

<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (1/day).</em></strong> If Ithuriel would fail a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> Ithuriel's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 19). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components:<br>
At will: detect evil and good<br>
1/day each: commune, raise dead</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> Ithuriel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fallen Grace.</em></strong> When Ithuriel is reduced to 0 hit points, his form expands and twists, becoming a massive creature with the head of a lion, the body of a ram, the wings of a bat, and the tail of a crocodile. His statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of his second form. His initiative count doesn't change, excess damage doesn't carry over to his new form, and he retains none of the conditions he had in his previous form.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Ithuriel makes two attacks. He can replace one of those attacks with <strong><em>ray of light</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mace.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) radiant damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Palm.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and Ithuriel can force the target to make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is pushed up to 10 feet away or grappled (escape DC 18).</p>
<p><strong><em>Ray of Light.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Spell Attack:</em> +10 to hit, range 30 feet, one target. <em>Hit:</em> The target takes 9 (2d8) radiant damage and is outlined in radiant light until the end of Ithuriel's next turn. Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Healing Touch (3/Day).</em></strong> Ithuriel touches another creature. The target magically regains 24 (4d8 + 5) hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.</p>
<p><strong><em>Change Shape.</em></strong> Ithuriel magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than his own, or back into its true form. He reverts to his true form if he is reduced to 0 hit points. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (Ithuriel's choice). In a new form, Ithuriel retains his game statistics and ability to speak, but his AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and he gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that he lacks.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Divine Wind.</em></strong> Ithuriel unleashes a powerful gale from his angelic wings in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) slashing damage and be pushed 10 feet away.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sacred Radiance (1/day).</em></strong> Ithuriel's form bursts with divine light. Each creature that can see him within 20 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) radiant damage. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is also blinded until the start of Ithuriel's next turn. A creature that fails the saving throw by 10 or more is also charmed by Ithuriel until the start of his next turn. While charmed in this way, the creature must fall prone to grovel before Ithuriel at the start of its turn, then immediately end its turn.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Ithuriel can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Ithuriel would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Punish.</em></strong> In response to an enemy hitting or missing him with a melee attack, Ithuriel makes a <strong><em>palm</em></strong> attack against it. 
<p><strong><em>Descend.</em></strong> In response hitting an enemy with a Palm attack or Punish reaction, if Ithuriel has grappled that enemy and is at least 40 feet in the air, he can then move up to his speed toward the ground without provoking opportunity attacks and force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target falls prone, it takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, and Ithuriel can use up to his remaining movement, if any, to push it in a straight line in any direction while grinding it against the earth, dealing an additional 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage per 10 feet moved along the ground. (This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Ascend.</em></strong> In response to taking damage, Ithuriel releases any creatures he has grappled, then flies up to one third of his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shift (Costs 2 Reactions).</em></strong> In response to suffering one of the following conditions, Ithuriel momentarily assumes the form of the corresponding beast, ending the condition: blinded (giant bat), grappled (octopus), paralyzed (giant poisonous snake), prone (giant spider), restrained (mouse), or stunned (jellyfish). Ithuriel then immediately returns to his true form.</p>

<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> Ithuriel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Ithuriel makes one attack with his claws and one with his bite or radiant darts</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) radiant damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and Ithuriel can't bite another target.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Radiant Darts.</em></strong> +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., three separate targets. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) radiant damage.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Erupt Earth.</em></strong> Ithuriel slams his tail against the ground, causing fountains of churned earth and stone to erupt in a 5-foot radius around him. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and fall prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Eclipse Beam (Recharge 5-6).</em></strong> Ithuriel exhales a burst of brilliant radiance and shadowy mirk in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) radiant damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Ithuriel can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Ithuriel would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> In response to being missed or hit by a melee attack, Ithuriel makes the following attack against the attacker: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d4 + 6) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw. On a failure, Ithuriel can either knock it prone or push it up to 5 feet away (Ithuriel's choice). </p>
<p><strong><em>Wings (1/round).</em></strong> In response to a creature he can see completing a spell, making an attack, or moving to a space within 60 feet of him, Ithuriel beats his wings, forcing each creature within 5 feet of him to succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet away and knocked prone. Ithuriel can then fly up to his speed toward the original creature without triggering opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence (1/day).</em></strong> In response to assuming his second form, Ithuriel forces each creature of his choice within 120 feet that is aware of him to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature is frightened of Ithuriel until the end of its next turn. A creature that fails the saving throw and has 30 hit points or fewer falls unconscious for 1 minute, until it takes damage, or until someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.</p>
</div>

### After Redemption
Ithuriel uses the statistics of a **pegasus**, but with the **healing touch** feature of a **unicorn** and the size, creature type, languages, and ***change shape*** feature of a **deva**. Replace the pegasus’s ***hooves*** attack with the following: ***Mace.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 1d6 + 4 bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) radiant damage. In addition, Ithuriel can cast *raise dead* once per day, but no more than three times per year.

**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Ithuriel should inspire endearment for his determination to repair the harm he has done, comfort for his deep compassion and care, and gratitude for his earnest efforts to aid the players.

***Emotions.*** Ithuriel most often feels thoughtful, sorrowful, cheerful, guilty, ashamed, apprehensive, defiant, bold, or serene.

***Motivations.*** Ithuriel wants to repair the harm he has done to Vasilka, the Belviews, the Krezkovs, and the players, and to defend the Abbey and the village of Krezk from those who might wish them harm.

***Inspirations.*** When roleplaying Ithuriel, channel Zuko (*Avatar: The Last Airbender*), Neji Hyuuga (*Naruto*), and Father Forthill (*The Dresden Files*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Ithuriel is a mature, contemplative youth with a strong sense of humility and a deep compassion for others. To those he trusts, Ithuriel is a young angel persevering to reassemble his purpose and identity following his corruption, defeat, and restoration.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Ithuriel would seek to calm his foe, but would not hesitate to forcefully defend an innocent threatened by enemies of ill intent.

## Vasilka
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Vasilka should inspire endearment for her clumsy sweetness, occasionally awkward naivete, overpowering innocence, insatiable love of learning, and ability to find a silver lining to every cloud; sympathy for her anxiety and fear of angering the Abbot; and flattery for her genuine and rapt fascination with the players and their heroic adventures.

***Emotions.*** Vasilka most often feels curious, joyful, thoughtful, shy, anxious, hopeful, and dreamy.

***Motivations.*** Vasilka wants to make the Abbot happy, befriend her **flesh golem** "brother," and learn as much as she can about people and the world.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Vasilka, channel Newt Scamander (*Fantastic Beasts*), Hinata Hyuuga (*Naruto*), and Alice (*Alice in Wonderland*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Vasilka is a polite, withdrawn, and well-mannered maiden. To those she trusts, she is a shy, occasionally anxious, and desperately curious spirit.

***Morale.*** At the time the players meet her, Vasilka would cower and plead for peace if attacked, not fighting even to defend herself.

***Relationships.*** Vasilka is the Abbot's creation and the "younger sister" of the Abbey's mindless **flesh golem**.



# The Wizard of Wines
When roleplaying the Martikov family, keep the following information in mind:

* **Adrian** is two years older than Urwin, and is generally quiet and observant, though he isn’t afraid to take charge when necessary. He takes no sides in the feud between Davian and Urwin and believes that Elric died fighting for what he believed in, and that his death should therefore be respected. Adrian should make the players feel flattered and grateful, and most often feels thoughtful, determined, or melancholy.
* **Elvir** is ten years younger than Urwin and the twin brother of the late Elric Martikov, and is generally sharp, sarcastic, and quick-tempered. He believes that Davian was wrong to scorn Urwin, and that the theft of the third enchanted gem likely wasn’t Urwin’s fault. He shares freely his position that Elric’s death was worthless, and that the whole family would be better off had he never gone to Castle Ravenloft to fight in Doru’s rebellion. Deep down, however, Elvir feels deeply betrayed that Elric would go to fight Strahd without him. Elvir should make the players feel irritated, insulted, sympathetic, and endeared to him, and most often feels frustrated, annoyed, melancholy, angry, determined, or amused.
* **Stefania** is five years older than Urwin. She doesn’t begrudge Urwin for the theft of the third enchanted gem, but shares Davian’s position that Urwin was most likely mistaken about what he saw. She believes that Elric’s death was a tragedy, but that he was an adult member of the Keepers of the Feather and that his choice therefore deserves respect. Stefania should make the players feel comforted and grateful, and most often feels cheerful or determined.
* **Dag**, who married into the Martikov family, takes no position on Davian’s feud with Urwin, though he shares Stefania’s position that Elric’s death was a tragedy but his choice deserves respect. He most often feels amused, thoughtful, playful, or determined, and should make the players feel grateful, amused, and endeared to him.
* **Claudiu** doesn’t care about Davian’s feud with Urwin, and believes that Elric’s death was a clear signal that resisting Strahd is hopeless and anyone who does so is doomed to failure. He most often feels grim, bored, annoyed, frustrated, or melancholy, and should make the players feel irritated, insulted, and sympathetic to him.
* **Martin and Viggo** don’t know about Davian’s feud with Urwin, who they have never met. They don’t understand the full nature of Elric’s revolt against Castle Ravenloft, but know enough to understand that he died there. They most often feel playful, bored, fearful, intrigued, or excited, and should make the players feel flattered, amused, and endeared to them.
* **Davian** is the patriarch of the Martikov family and the widower of his late wife, Mirabel Oraonova. Publicly, he avows that Elric was a fool, insubordinate, and disobedient for refusing Davian’s command to stay away from Castle Ravenloft. Deep down, Davian is shattered that the last words he spoke to his son before Elric’s death were, “*And don’t come back!*" Davian most often feels annoyed, irritated, satisfied, or grumpy, and should make the players feel insulted, grateful, and sympathetic to him.

# The Werewolf Den
## Bianca Stoyanovich
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** When the players first meet her, Bianca should inspire sympathy for her anxiety and uncertainty and endearment for her good spirits in the faith of a stressful dilemma.

***Emotions.*** Bianca most often feels melancholy, cheerful, amused, thoughtful, curious, desperate, or anxious.

***Motivations.*** Bianca wants to keep Kiril safe, happy, and sane while protecting the pack and innocent Barovians from his wrath, hunger, and ambitions.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Bianca, channel Yennefer of Vengerberg (*The Witcher*), Rogue (*X-Men*), and Princess Amidala (*Star Wars*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Bianca is an excitable, albeit surprisingly refined woman. To those she trusts, Bianca is anxious and desperate to bring Kiril back from the brink of madness. Deep down, Bianca wonders if she regrets joining Kiril as a **werewolf**.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Bianca would attempt to negotiate or flee, but fight savagely if cornered.

***Relationships.*** Bianca is Kiril's mate and wife, and the disinherited daughter of a noble family outside of Barovia.

<strong>
<p>strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Kiril regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn. If he takes necrotic damage or bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a silvered weapon, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn
<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (1/day).</em></strong> If Kiril fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> If Kiril would be paralyzed or stunned, he is slowed instead. (His speed is halved, he has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and creatures have advantage on attacks made against him.)
<p><strong><em>Keen Hearing and Smell.</em></strong> Kiril has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</p>
<p><strong><em>Second Phase.</em></strong> When Kiril is reduced to 0 hit points, he digs his claws into his chest, pulls out his own heart, and devours it. He then doubles in height and breadth, gaining a hunched back, bony protrusions along his arms and shoulders, and a grotesque, bloated head with oversized fangs and teeth, as well as a pair of toothy jaws for eyes. His statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of his second form. His initiative count doesn’t change. Excess damage and conditions don’t carry over to his new form.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Kiril makes three melee attacks, up to one of which can be a Bite.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>, +9 to hit, range 5 ft., 1 target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>, +9 to hit, range 5 ft., 1 target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a Humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werewolf lycanthropy until Kiril dies. If the target was already cursed with werewolf lycanthropy, it can't regenerate until it completes a long rest.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Alpha's Howl.</em></strong> Any number of targets within 60 feet that can hear Kiril and that Kiril has cursed with werewolf lycanthropy must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, losing one level of lycanthrope corruption on a success (minimum 0). On a failure, a target gains one level of lycanthrope corruption (maximum 2) and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move up to its speed toward a random creature other than Kiril and make a number of unarmed strikes against it equal to its number of levels of lycanthrope corruption.</p>
<p>A target with one level of lycanthrope corruption gains wolflike claws and can use its claws to make an unarmed strike, dealing 2d4 slashing damage plus its Strength modifier (minimum 2) on a hit. A target with two levels of lycanthrope corruption also gains a wolflike muzzle and can use its bite to make an unarmed strike, dealing 1d8 piercing damage plus its Strength modifier (minimum 2) on a hit. A Humanoid bitten in this way must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werewolf lycanthropy until Kiril dies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Savage Frenzy.</em></strong> Kiril leaps up to his speed without triggering opportunity attacks. Each creature within 5 feet of him must then make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
<p><strong><em>Shapechange.</em></strong> Kiril polymorphs into his human form or into a dire wolf, or back into his true form (a wolf-humanoid hybrid). His statistics, other than his AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. He reverts to his human form if he dies.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Kiril can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Kiril would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pounce.</em></strong>  In response to a creature moving within 30 feet, Kiril moves up to his speed toward it without triggering opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> In response to being missed by an attack made by a creature within 5 feet, Kiril attacks that creature with his claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> In response to being hit by an attack made by a creature within 5 feet, Kiril attacks that creature with his bite.</p>

<p><strong><em>Keen Hearing and Smell.</em></strong> Kiril has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</p>
<p><strong><em>Weak Grip.</em></strong> If Kiril takes 30 damage or more on a single turn, he must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw at the end of that turn or release any creatures he is grappling.
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Kiril makes one attack with his claws and one attack with his bite. He can replace the bite with a swallow if he already has a target restrained with his bite.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, range 10 ft., 1 target. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be pushed 5 feet away or grappled (Kiril's choice).</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, range 10 ft., 1 target. Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and Kiril can't bite another target.</p>
<p><strong><em>Swallow.</em></strong> Kiril makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature he has restrained with his bite. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside Kiril, and it takes 7 (2d6) acid damage at the start of each of Kiril's turns. If Kiril takes 20 damage or more on a single turn, he must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of him. Kiril must also immediately regurgitate all swallowed creatures if he dies.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Nightmare Howl.</em></strong> Each creature within 60 feet of Kiril that can hear him must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 5 (2d4) psychic damage and is frightened until the start of Kiril's next turn. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target can’t be frightened by Kiril's Nightmare Howl for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shadow Beam.</em></strong> A 5-foot-wide, 100-foot-long beam of swirling shadows bursts from Kiril’s maw. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. A target grappled by Kiril’s bite automatically fails the saving throw.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Kiril can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Kiril would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Leap.</em></strong> In response to a creature moving within 30 feet, Kiril leaps toward it without provoking opportunity attacks. Each creature within a 5-foot radius of him must then immediately make a DC 18 Strength saving throw or fall prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rend.</em></strong> In response to a creature moving within his reach, Kiril attacks it with his claws. If the attack misses, that creature has advantage on its next attack against Kiril before the start of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pin.</em></strong> In response to being missed by an attack made by a creature within reach, Kiril forces that creature to make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failure, that creature is knocked prone and either shoved 20 feet away or grappled (Kiril's choice).</p>

## Brother Marek
In death, Brother Marek is a cold, apathetic shell of a man. His once-jovial cheer has wizened to a dry, sarcastic cynicism, and he views the Order’s fates as damnation for their failures. However, he is not without compassion, and truly wishes the players nothing but the best—so long as they abandon their foolish efforts to stir up the spirits of Argynvostholt. Brother Marek’s spirit should make the players feel irritated, insulted, and sympathetic, and most often feels melancholy, annoyed, skeptical, bitter, resigned, bemused, or disapproving.
## Commander Vladimir Horngaard
**Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Vladimir should inspire unease and discomfort with his suspicion and paranoia, (restrained) anger with his apathy for the plight of the Barovian people, and pity for the ways in which his rage and pain have blinded him.

***Emotions.*** Vladimir most often feels suspicious, enraged, irritated, placid, stoic, or apathetic.

***Motivations.*** Vladimir wants to preserve Strahd's prison in the Mists to avenge his desecration of Argynvost's corpse and the destruction of the Order of the Silver Dragon.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Vladimir, channel Stannis Baratheon (*Game of Thrones*), Frank Castle (*The Punisher*), and Rorschach (*Watchmen*).

**Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Vladimir is a cruel, apathetic, and self-righteous creature consumed by vengeance and hatred.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Vladimir would gladly take up arms against any person that insulted, disobeyed, or threatened him.

***Relationships.*** Vladimir is the commander of the Order of the Silver Dragon, the source of the other revenants' undeath (through the oath they swore him), and the husband of Sir Godfrey Gwilym (whose relationship to him Vladimir has forgotten).

<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (1/day).</em></strong> If Vladimir would fail a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Vladimir regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Vladimir's body is destroyed only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.</p>
<p><strong><em>Turn Immunity.</em></strong> Vladimir is immune to effects that turn undead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Oathbind.</em></strong> If Vladimir would deal damage to a dying creature with his <strong><em>+2 greatsword</em></strong>, he can instead choose to stabilize that creature and subject it to the effects of a <em>geas</em> spell. This geas lasts until dispelled and can damage its bearer any number of times each day. A creature that takes damage in this way is also restrained until the start of its next turn. In addition, the geas can’t be ended or dispelled except through the effects of a <em>greater restoration</em> or <em>wish</em> spell, or if Vladimir uses an action to dismiss it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Burning Hatred.</em></strong> When Vladimir is reduced to 0 hit points, black flames erupt along the hilt of his greatsword and the shadows encircling its blade become spiked black wires. His statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of his second form. His initiative count doesn't change, excess damage doesn't carry over to his new form, and he retains none of the conditions he had in his previous form.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Vladimir makes two attacks with his <strong><em>+2 greatsword</em></strong>. He can replace one of those attacks with one use of his <strong><em>conjure phantoms</em></strong> action.</p>
<p><strong><em>Greatsword +2.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage, and Vladimir can push the target up to 5 ft. away. Instead of pushing the target, Vladimir can force the target to make a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Conjure Phantoms.</em></strong> Vladimir summons a pair of <strong>phantom warriors</strong>, which appear next to a hostile creature that Vladimir can see. Each warrior makes a <strong><em>spectral longsword</em></strong> attack against that creature, then disappears. A creature that takes damage in this way can’t regain hit points until the start of Vladimir’s next turn.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Reaving Sweep.</em></strong> Vladimir sweeps his greatsword in an arc with thunderous force, creating a shockwave that rips through a 15-foot cone in front of him. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (6d6) slashing damage and be pushed back 5 feet. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage and isn’t pushed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Umbral Snare.</em></strong> Black-spiked wires extrude from the earth around Vladimir in a 5-foot radius. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) piercing damage and be grappled by the wires (escape DC 19) until the start of Vladimir’s next turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage and isn’t grappled. A creature that attempts to escape the grapple immediately takes an additional 7 (2d6) piercing damage, whether it succeeds or fails.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Vladimir can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Vladimir would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sworn Retribution (1/round).</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a creature he can see, Vladimir marks that creature until the end of his next turn. While that creature is marked, Vladimir doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when moving directly toward it, he has advantage on the first melee attack he makes against that creature each turn and his weapon attacks against that creature score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ghostly Command.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Vladimir conjures a phantom soldier to shield him, reducing the damage taken by half (rounded up). This ability can’t reduce Vladimir’s damage taken by more than 10.</p>
<p><strong><em>Martial Reprisal.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Vladimir moves up to half his speed toward the attacker or caster and makes an against it with his <strong><em>+2 greatsword</em></strong> if it's within reach.</p>

<p><strong><em>Oathbind.</em></strong> If Vladimir would kill a creature with his <strong><em>+2 greatsword</em></strong>, he can instead choose to stabilize that creature and subject it to the effects of a <em>geas</em> spell.

<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Vladimir makes two melee attacks. He can replace one of those attacks with a <strong><em>black flames</em></strong> attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Greatsword +2.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it has disadvantage on the first attack roll or ability check it makes before the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Black Flames.</em></strong> Ranged Spell Attack: +10 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) cold damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage, and the target ignites in black flames. At the start of its next turn, the target and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take an additional 7 (2d6) cold damage. (The flames can’t be doused by nonmagical means.)</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Gravepyre.</em></strong> Vladimir hurls a magical ball of black flames that explodes at a point he can see within 120 feet of him. Each creature in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 10 (3d6) cold damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failure, a creature also has disadvantage on the next attack it makes before the start of Vladimir’s next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Destructive Wave.</em></strong> Vladimir strikes the ground with his greatsword, creating a burst of destructive energy that ripples outward from him. Each creature within 10 feet of him must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) thunder damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Vladimir can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Vladimir would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vengeful Rush.</em></strong> In response to an enemy hitting or missing him with an attack, Vladimir charges toward it, moving up to 15 feet straight toward it without triggering opportunity attacks. If Vladimir ends his movement within 5 feet of that enemy, he can force it to make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and Vladimir and the target move up to an additional 10 feet in the same direction without triggering opportunity attacks. If the target can’t move the full distance, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 5 feet not moved.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vengeful Glare.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an enemy within 30 feet, Vladimir forces that creature to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is frightened of Vladimir until Vladimir deals damage to it or until the end of Vladimir’s next turn. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is paralyzed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sentinel’s Strike.</em></strong> In response to a creature attempting to move out of his reach without first taking the Disengage action, Vladimir makes an attack against it with his <strong><em>+2 greatsword</em></strong>. On a hit, the creature takes no damage from the attack, but it falls prone and its speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.</p>
