# Act I: Into the Mists
<div class="subtitle"><em>For 2nd to 3rd-level characters.</em></div>
In this act, the players are lured into the haunted Death House, which mystically transports them into the land of Barovia. As the players gain their bearings, they travel to the village of Barovia, where they meet burgomaster Ismark Kolyanovich and his sister, Ireena Kolyana, and learn about the mysterious Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire that has recently awoken to plague the Barovian valley. 

The players are asked to escort Ireena to the nearby town of Vallaki for safety; if the players agree, Ireena also asks them to assist in the burial of her late father, Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich. While at the local church, the players meet Doru, a **vampire spawn** at war with his bloodthirsty nature, and have an opportunity to reconcile him with his father, the priest Donavich.

Upon receiving a warning and invitation sent in a dream from the Vistani seer Madam Eva, the players depart the village of Barovia for a Vistani encampment at nearby Tser Pool. Following a brief encounter with Strahd himself, the players receive a mystical Tarokka reading from Madam Eva, who foretells the location of three mystical artifacts—and a companion—who will help them defeat Strahd.

As the players travel to Madam Eva's camp and the nearby town of Vallaki, they encounter a number of characters with ties to possible future adventures, as well as some adversarial encounters that will test their tactics, coordination, and combat skill.

Upon their arrival in Vallaki, the players can find shelter at the Blue Water Inn, and—if she is with them—help Ireena seek shelter at St. Andral’s Church. The act ends when the players take their first long rest in Vallaki.
# Act II: The Shadowed Town
<div class="subtitle"><em>For characters of 4th level and higher.</em></div>
In this act, the players are left to explore the shadowed town of Vallaki—a Barovian settlement that has fallen to tension and conflict in the wake of Strahd's awakening.

As the players seek to complete lingering obligations—escorting Ireena to St. Andral's Church, purchasing and delivering a toy for the Vistani child Arabelle, and uncovering the *Tome of Strahd*—they meet new allies and enemies, including Father Lucian, the priest of St. Andral's Church; Izek Strazni, Baron Vallakovich's brutal enforcer; and Lady Fiona Wachter, the Baron's Strahd-loyalist rival.

At St. Andral's Church, the players will be tasked with recovering the stolen bones of St. Andral in order to protect the church's holy protection. At the nearby Vistani encampment, the players will have an opportunity to prove themselves heroes by finding and rescuing Arabelle following her mysterious disappearance—and receive a mysterious prophecy if they do. And at Wachterhaus, the ancestral home of House Wachter, the players will be given a choice: slay Izek Strazni and allow Lady Wachter to seize power—or do nothing, and allow the Baron's mad reign to continue.

Meanwhile, one of the players begins to experience haunting apparitions, leading them to discover the tragic fate of Stella Wachter's soul—and an opportunity to restore her broken mind. Simultaneously, a nocturnal killer haunts Vallaki's streets, secretly working to drive the disguised vampire hunter Dr. Rudolph van Richten out of hiding.

Through it all, the players will have an opportunity to seek out clues leading to the hidden location of the *Tome of Strahd*, which—depending on the Tarokka reading they received—may be hidden in the Baron's mansion or in Wachterhaus. And as the date of the Festival of the Blazing Sun approaches, Izek Strazni and Ireena Kolyana grow closer to a fateful, yet tragic encounter.

Act II ends on the morning after the players' first full moon in Barovia, which takes place on the night of the sixth full day after they first arrive in Vallaki. However, the players can still complete unresolved arcs from this act even after Act III begins—assuming, of course, that those arcs are still possible to complete.
# Act III: The Broken Land
<div class="subtitle"><em>For characters of 5th level and higher.</em></div>

In this act, the players receive a plea from Urwin Martikov to investigate the Wizard of Wines winery—and an invitation from Strahd to dine at Castle Ravenloft.

If the players agree to Urwin's request in [[Arc J - The Stolen Gem]], they are joined by Muriel Vinshaw—the secret identity of the disguised **wereraven** that they rescued near Tser Pool. As the players work to free the winery from the scourge of druids and blights that have invaded it, Muriel relays an excerpt of Strahd's foretelling to Davian Martikov, an elder **wereraven** and the leader of the Keepers of the Feather.

Upon freeing the winery from the druids' clutches, Davian asks them to journey to Yester Hill to the south, where the druids are plotting a dark ritual that threatens the vineyard's destruction. Once the players have recovered the winery's stolen gemstone and returned it to Davian Martikov, they can learn the true nature of the Keepers of the Feather and gain Muriel's knowledge of Strahd's cryptic fortunetelling.

Should the players accept Strahd's invitation to dine at Ravenloft, they will have one week to explore the valley before the occasion begins. As they do, they might recruit the monster hunter Ezmerelda d'Avenir from Krezk in [[Arc K - The Fallen Abbey]], investigate the lost *Holy Symbol of Ravenloft* in [[Arc L - The Den of Wolves]], or visit the haunted mansion of Argynvostholt in [[Arc M - The Dragon's Manor]].

In Krezk, the players will learn that the Abbot of the Abbey of Saint Markovia has fallen into madness, and that the key to cleansing his divine spirit lies amongst the crypts of Castle Ravenloft. In the Werewolf Den, the players will receive an offer from Zuleika, a **werewolf** priestess of Mother Night: To receive the *Holy Symbol*, they must first rescue her mate from the castle dungeons. At Argynvostholt, the players receive a solemn missive from the spirit of the silver dragon Argynvost: return his stolen skull from the desecrated grounds of the castle cellar and restore it its rightful tomb. 

On the night of [[Arc O - Dinner with the Devil]], the players are escorted by Strahd's black carriage to the castle, where they will meet Strahd's servants, brides, and consorts. After dining with Strahd and touring the castle, the players will learn that Strahd will be away from the castle the following night, providing the players free reign to infiltrate the keep. Not long thereafter, however, a bolt of lightning disables the drawbridge, forcing them to remain as Strahd's guests until morning—and survive an old and vengeful spirit in the process.

Should the players survive, they are free to return the following night for [[Arc P - Ravenloft Heist]], where they must battle Strahd's brides and servants to fulfill their assorted quests. Should they escape, they can then return to purify the Abbot, defeat the werewolf alpha Kiril Stoyanovich, and light the radiant beacon of Argynvostholt.

Act III ends when the players recruit the dusk elf Kasimir to journey to the Amber Temple. When the act ends, the **tree blight** Wintersplinter destroys the Wizard of Wines winery unless the players stopped the druids' ritual in [[Arc J - The Stolen Gem]].
# Act IV: Secrets of the Ancient
<div class="subtitle"><em>For characters of 8th level and higher.</em></div>

Throughout this act, and until the players light the *Sunsword*, Strahd—having now assumed his [[Strahd von Zarovich#The Tyrant|Tyrant persona]] following the players' heist of Castle Ravenloft—appears nightly to torment them in [[Arc R - The Tyrant's Trials]], seeking to test their ambition, cunning, power, and capacity for cruelty.

Meanwhile, the players journey with the dusk elf Kasimir Velikov to the Amber Temple, traveling along Tsolenka Pass as they ascend Mount Ghakis in [[Arc S - The Amber Temple]]. As they do, they can befriend the Mountain Folk of Soldav, including Elder Burebis, an ancient **storm giant** and devotee of the Ladies Three. From Burebis, the players can learn of the three Fanes of Barovia, and of the profane knowledge that Strahd took from the Amber Temple to desecrate them.

After overcoming the trials of Mount Ghakis's slopes, including Strahd's chamberlain Rahadin, the **giant goat** Sangzor, multiple fiends corrupted by the Amber Temple, and the **roc** of Mount Ghakis itself, the players can finally arrive at their destination. Within the Amber Temple, the players can obtain the broken hilt of the *Sunsword*, as well as the arcane secrets that Strahd used to corrupt the Barovian Fanes—and which can, in turn, be used to restore them.

Upon restoring the memory of the **lich** Exethanter and sharing with him the schematics found in the *Tome of Strahd*, the players can also learn Strahd's ultimate plan: to channel the power of the Fanes into the indestructible Heart of Sorrow within Castle Ravenloft, which Strahd will use to tear open the Mists and escape. The players will also learn that Strahd plans to consume the souls of all Barovia in order to power his audacious scheme, and that he cannot ever truly be killed unless severed from the Fanes' power.

When the players have recovered the broken hilt of the *Sunsword*, a mysterious dream invites them to return to the Shrine of the White Sun in Krezk. There, they are met by Madam Eva, who provides the players with the Martikovs' long-lost enchanted gemstone, and the ghost of Sergei von Zarovich, who uses the power of the blessed pool to restore the *Sunsword's* radiant blade.

If Ireena still accompanies the players, Sergei invites her to take sanctuary at the Shrine—an offer which she denies if the players have treated her with kindness and courage. If she rejects him, Sergei advises Ireena to journey to the ruined manor in Berez, where a wandering spirit can help her learn the true nature of Strahd's curse—and her own.

As the players depart Krezk, they learn that the swamp-witch Baba Lysaga has kidnapped three of the Martikovs from the Wizard of Wines winery—and that she is planning to sacrifice them in a foul and profane ritual. Should the players defeat her in [[Arc T - The Witch of Berez]], Lysaga unleashes the power of the Three Sisters: three twisted leeches that Strahd set to devour the energies of the Fanes, and which now aim to spread hatred, envy, and despair across the valley.

In [[Arc U - The Ladies of the Fanes]], the players must use Leo Dilisnya's dagger to expose and defeat each leech in turn—the Gulthias Tree at the Forest Fane upon Yester Hill; the corpse of Ismark the Great at the Swamp Fane in Berez; and the dead egg of the Roc of Mount Ghakis at the Mountain Fane beneath Old Bonegrinder—before using the winery's three gems to reconsecrate each Fane in turn. As they do, the land grows ever-more hostile to the players' presence, the very plants, earth, and storms of Barovia obstructing their path.

Act IV ends when the players reconsecrate all three Fanes.
# Act V: The Curse of Strahd
<div class="subtitle"><em>For characters of 9th level and higher.</em></div>
In this act, soon after the last Fane is restored, Strahd's masterstroke unfolds. By releasing the stored energy bound within the Heart of Sorrow, Strahd plunges Barovia into an eternal night—and turns the valley itself into desecrated ground. Meanwhile, the Whispering Wall—resonating with the energies of the Heart of Sorrow—relocates to the surface of Lake Zarovich, where its deadly tendrils threaten to extinguish all life in Vallaki in [[Arc V - Forgotten Dreams]].

Even once the Whispering Wall is quelled, however, a greater danger emerges in [[Arc W - The Curse of Strahd]]. As an undead apocalypse threatens to overwhelm the Barovian people, the players must journey to Castle Ravenloft to face Strahd at the Heart of Sorrow. As the final battle unfolds, the Heart of Sorrow shows visions of Strahd's undead siege from across Barovia—and of the heroic resistance shown by the allies and friends that the players have made across their journey:

***Village of Barovia.*** If the players escorted Ireena to Vallaki, reconciled Doru with Father Donavich, befriended Dr. Rudolph van Richten in Vallaki, and inspired Ireena to reject Sergei's invitation, the village of Barovia is saved by the leadership and prowess of Ismark Kolyanovich, Doru and Donavich, Dr. Van Richten and the **ghost** Erasmus van Richten, and the spirit of Sergei von Zarovich.

***Town of Vallaki.*** If the players restored the soul of Stella Wachter, aided Lady Fiona Wachter in defeating Izek Strazni, located the missing Vistana Arabelle, recovered the stolen bones of St. Andral, and rescued the Blue Water Inn from Baba Lysaga, the town of Vallaki is saved by the power and foresight of Lady Fiona Wachter and her cult; the young **mage** Victor Vallakovich; the Vistani Luvash, Arrigal, and Arabelle; the dusk elves; the priest Father Lucian Petrovich; and the **wereravens** Urwin Martikov and Danika Dorakova.

***Village of Krezk.*** If the players rescued Ilya Krezkov from the Werewolf Den, rescued Emil Toranescu from the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, and restored the Abbot's divine grace, the village of Krezk is saved by the might and savagery of the redeemed Abbot, the Belview **mongrelfolk**, the Krezkov **werewolves**, and Emil's new **werewolf** pack.

***Wizard of Wines.*** If the players saved the Wizard of Wines from the druids and Wintersplinter, defeated Baba Lysaga, and relit the beacon of Argynvostholt, the winery is saved by the combined efforts of the Keepers of the Feather and the spirits of the Order of the Silver Dragon.

***Settlement of Soldav.*** If the players aided the Mountain Folk within the Amber Temple and reconsecrated the Fanes of Barovia, the settlement of Soldav is saved by the sudden arrival of the Mountain Folk warrior Helwa, the chieftain Kavan and his warband of spirits, the bestial spirits of the Huntress, and the **roc** of Mount Ghakis itself.

Should the players defeat Strahd, the Mists vanish and the sun rises over Barovia once again—a free land, at long last.
