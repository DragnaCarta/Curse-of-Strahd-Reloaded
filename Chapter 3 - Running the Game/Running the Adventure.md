# Adventure Organization
While *Curse of Strahd*, like most official campaign modules, is organized around specific areas and locations, *Curse of Strahd: Reloaded* is organized around **narratives**:

* **Acts.** An **act** is a collection of adventures with similar settings and stakes that are meant to be completed in approximately the same timeframe (e.g., "adventures in Vallaki").
* **Arcs.** An **arc** is a high-concept adventure within an act that has a particular goal (e.g., "restore the bones of Saint Andral").
* **Chapters.** A **chapter** is a portion of an arc that takes place within a particular location (e.g., "the coffin-maker's shop").
* **Scenes.** A **scene** is a particular scene that unfolds at a particular time and place within a chapter (e.g., "battling the vampire spawn").

While no *Dungeons & Dragons* campaign can be perfectly predicted, this guide uses a strategy of strong "dramatic questions," flexible narrative design, and the author's experience in running *Curse of Strahd* campaigns to craft a "critical path" of arcs, chapters, and scenes that are most likely to lead your players on your journey through Barovia.

Note that, because *Curse of Strahd* is a sandbox campaign, it is reasonably possible for the players to trigger a new act before completing all of the adventure arcs in the previous act. If this happens, the players can still continue and complete any adventure arcs in the previous acts—assuming, of course, that it is still possible for those arcs to be completed. (For example, if the players fail to recover the bones of Saint Andral before the night of Saint Andral's Feast, the congregation of Saint Andral's Church is massacred and the quest can no longer be completed.)

It is, of course, always possible for players to go "off the rails" and forge their own path in this adventure. This guide's Session Zero guidelines have been shaped with the explicit intent of minimizing this possibility (by, for example, discouraging players from creating non-heroic characters). However, it is important to remember that this guide's narrative presents, at best, a single "critical path" that your players may follow, and that the threads of fate might always guide them along another.

> [!info]+ **Levels & Milestones**
> *Curse of Strahd: Reloaded* allows players to increase their level by earning experience points each time they complete a story milestone. Players will ordinarily earn a specified amount of milestone XP each time they complete an arc. Players might also earn additional milestone XP for completing a segment of an arc, or by completing optional "bonus content."
> 
> Players can earn XP only where noted in the guide, and cannot earn XP by defeating monsters or other means.

> [!design]- **Design Note: Milestone XP**
> *Curse of Strahd* is, at its core, a nonlinear adventure. Although *Curse of Strahd: Reloaded* provides additional structure to the sandbox, each act can still be completed in a variety of different ways, with some arcs potentially remaining unfinished until a far-later act. Additionally, because most arcs within an act can be completed in any order, most acts lack a clear "climax" or "capstone," which means that players may often feel anxious for a sense of progression while mid-act.
> 
> Milestone XP resolves these problems, ensuring that players have a sense of mechanical progression as they complete arcs while also assigning an amount of XP commensurate with each arc's difficulty.
# Adventure Hooks
In contrast to the original *Curse of Strahd* module, this guide offers a single, original adventure hook to guide the players into Barovia. In this hook, Death House serves as a portal to Strahd's domain: the players enter Death House in their own world, and—upon defeating or pacifying the cult—emerge into the land of Barovia. However, this hook can be implemented in two possible ways:

* ***Lost in the Mists.*** In this version, the players are members of a mercenary adventuring party that has been hired to investigate a series of mysterious disappearances tied to a particular house (Death House). This hook focuses the players' attention solely on Strahd's tyranny and the Barovians who suffer under his rule, encouraging the players to immerse themselves in the campaign's lore and to develop unique relationships with its diverse cast of characters.
* ***Barovian Relics.*** In this version, one or more players possess certain relics that originated from Barovia and are tied to their backstories.  When Death House manifests nearby, those relics are drawn to it, encouraging the players to enter and investigate. (Any players who do not wish to craft a backstory may instead choose to be a mercenary investigating recent disappearances, as in ***Lost in the Mists***.) This hook focuses the players' attentions on their own interests and personal connections to the land of Barovia, encouraging them to invest their attention in NPCs and locations tied to their unique relics.

In general, ***Lost in the Mists*** may be viewed as a "pure" version of *Curse of Strahd*, focusing its narrative on the isolation and alienation of Barovia. By contrast, ***Barovian Relics*** is best used by Dungeon Masters who are passionate about Barovia's gothic atmosphere and environment, but whose players require a personal connection to the campaign to be emotionally invested.

See ***Arc A. Escape From Death House*** and **A1. Daggerford** for more information about how to run these hooks. If you choose to run ***Barovian Relics*** for one or more of your players, have each of those players choose a motivation from the ***Motivations*** section in **Chapter 1: Into the Mists** before beginning the campaign.
# Strahd’s Spies
One or more of Strahd's spies check in on the players once each day and once each night, as described in **Strahd's Spies** (p. 29). However, the nature of Strahd’s spies may vary with the players’ location and the time of day. Use the following table when planning an encounter with a spy:

|      Location      |           Day Encounter            |           Night Encounter            |
| :----------------: | :--------------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |
| Village of Barovia |        1 Vistani **bandit**        |        1d4 **swarms of bats**        |
|   Svalich Woods    |      1 **wolf** or **druid**       | 1 **wolf** or 1d4 **swarms of bats** |
|  Town of Vallaki   |        1 **swarm of rats**         |         1 **swarm of bats**          |
|  Village of Krezk  |        1 **swarm of rats**         |         1 **swarm of bats**          |
|    Mount Ghakis    | 1 **dire wolf** or 1 **berserker** |         1 **swarm of bats**          |

Strahd's spies, which all understand Common, report the following information, which you should track using the [**Strahd's Espionage** handout](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/Strahd's%20Espionage.pdf):

* any conversations that the players are heard having;
* any spells, weapons, or abilities that the players are seen using; and
* any locations or NPCs that the players are seen visiting.
# Encounters with Strahd
Throughout the adventure, the players will have numerous encounters with Strahd von Zarovich. After meeting Strahd for the first time at the River Ivlis Crossroads (see [[Act I - Into the Mists/Arc C - Into the Valley]]), the players may later speak with him at Yester Hill (see [[Arc J - The Stolen Gem]]) and dine with him at Castle Ravenloft (see [[Arc O - Dinner with the Devil]]).

Once Strahd learns that the players have obtained the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind* or relit the beacon of Argynvostholt, he refocuses his efforts toward determining whether any of them are worthy to serve as generals or consorts in his court. See ***Arc R: The Tyrant's Trials*** for more information.

> [!warning]+ **Combat Tactics**
> Combat encounters in this guide have been designed using [Challenge Ratings 2.0](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-N4m46K77hpMVnh7upYa), a system that calibrates encounter difficulty to ensure challenging, balanced encounters. Unless specifically provided in this guide, or unless necessary to compete with players using similar tactics, enemies (including Strahd) should not need to use any tactics (e.g., targeting weak players or focus-firing) in order to provide a challenging experience.
# The Tarokka Reading
## The Tome of Strahd
The contents of the Tome of Strahd are now as described in [[Arc H - The Lost Soul#I9a. Reading the Tome|Arc I - The Lost Soul]].
## The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind
The *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind* has been revised as follows:

<div class="item">
<h3>Holy Symbol of Ravenkind</h3>
<div class="subtitle"><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)</em></div>
<p>The holy symbol has 5 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dawn's Embrace.</em></strong> As a reaction, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 charge to cause that creature to drop to 1 hit point instead. That creature gains immunity to all damage until the start of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Light of Hope.</em></strong> As an action, you can expend 1 charge and choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. All of the following conditions on that creature end: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sun’s Blessing.</em></strong> As an action, you can expend 3 charges to cause holy power to radiate from the symbol in a 30-foot radius for 1 minute. Nonhostile creatures in that radius deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage when they hit with a weapon attack.</p>
<p>You can also use the holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric and paladin spells. You gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your cleric and paladin spells.</p>
</div>

## The Sunsword
The *Sunsword* cannot be attuned to when the players first obtain it. Instead, the players must submerge it in the blessed pool near the Shrine of the White Sun to restore its radiant blade. (The hilt retains its sentience and ability to communicate telepathically before its blade is restored.) For more information about this arc, see ***Arc V: The Sunsword*** below.

Note that the *Sunsword* is a sentient magic item; as described in **Conflict** (*Dungeon Master's Guide*, p. 216), it may make demands of its wielder or attempt to seize control of them if they act contrary to its will. (This is especially likely to occur if, for example, its wielder is charmed by Strahd von Zarovich.)
## Strahd’s Enemy
Strahd's enemy no longer possesses the ***Inspire*** action (**Strahd's Enemy**, p. 15). Instead, if she confronts the Dark Powers at Marina's Monument in Berez (see ***Arc X: Whispers of the Mists***), Ireena Kolyana gains this ability as a bonus action. See ***Arc B: Welcome to Barovia*** for more information about Ireena's statistics.
## The Card Reading
Immediately before the scene in which the players meet Madam Eva, if you are using a physical Tarokka deck for the reading, choose which five cards Madam Eva will draw and stack them on top of the deck in the order described in <strong>Card Reading</strong> (p. 11).

When choosing which card(s) to use for which part of the reading, select from the following lists.
### The Tome of Strahd
The Tome of Strahd is not present in the Material Plane of Barovia. Instead, the **Nine of Glyphs—Traitor*** foretells that it is held by the **gallows speaker** Leo Dilisnya within the Ethereal Plane. See [[Arc H - The Lost Soul]] for more information about the gallows speaker.
### The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind
Place the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind* in the shrine of Mother Night in the werewolf den (***Five of Swords—Myrmidon***).
### The Sunsword
Place the *Sunsword* in the sealed treasury of the Amber Temple (***Eight of Glyphs—Bishop***).
### Strahd's Enemy
Assign the role of Strahd's Enemy to Ezmerelda d'Avenir (***Mists—Queen of Spades***).
### Strahd's Location
Assign Strahd's location in Castle Ravenloft to **K20. Heart of Sorrow**, represented by the ***Marionette (Jack of Hearts).*** 
# Design Notes: Running the Adventure
## The Tarokka Reading
***The Tome of Strahd.*** The *Tome of Strahd* has been expanded to provide the players with secret information about Strahd's ultimate plan, as well as additional hooks to the Fanes of Barovia and the Amber Temple. (If the players restore his memory and show him the *Tome*, the **lich** Exethanter can interpret Strahd's ciphers and notes at their request.) 

The *Tome* has been intentionally placed in Vallaki to ensure that the players find it (and are intrigued by its mysteries) as early as possible. Because they tie strongly into other quests, Rictavio's wagon (***Seven of Stars—Illusionist***) and the attic of the Blue Water Inn (***Master of Coins—Rogue***) have been removed as possible locations.

***The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind.*** The statistics of the *Holy Symbol* have been revised in order to ensure that its utility is not overshadowed by the *Sunsword* once the latter is obtained and to replace its nonstrategic *Hold Vampires* and *Turn Undead* features with tactical, engaging abilities. Its class restrictions for attunement have been removed to ensure that any party can use it—with or without a cleric or paladin.

The *Holy Symbol* has been intentionally placed in the Werewolf Den to ensure that the players find it after they have already confronted Strahd's brides (in Vallaki and at Yester Hill), but before they invade any truly dangerous locations (e.g., Castle Ravenloft, the Amber Temple, or the ruins of Berez). 

The four foretellings leading to Krezk—the scarecrow in the garden of the Abbey of Saint Markovia (***Two of Glyphs—Missionary***), the main hall of the Abbey (***One of Glyphs—Monk***), the nursery of the Abbey (***Two of Coins—Philanthropist***), and the gazebo in the Shrine of the White Sun (***Three of Glyphs—Healer***)—have been removed to ensure that the players do not fulfill two of their Tarokka readings (i.e., both the *Holy Symbol* and Strahd's Enemy) while within the same relative area.

***The Sunsword.*** The *Sunsword*'s radiant blade has been withheld from the players to create a more organic opportunity to meet the spirit of Sergei von Zarovich, to manufacture a late-game interaction between Sergi and Ireena, and to create a more climactic and engaging narrative. 

Due to its power in combat against Strahd, the *Sunsword* has been intentionally placed in the Amber Temple—the most dangerous and isolated location in the game—to ensure that the players do not obtain it too early. This placement also ensures that the players have a reliable hook to the Temple and a rewarding goal to achieve while there.

***Strahd's Enemy.*** All possible allies other than the Vistana monster hunter Ezmerelda d'Avenir have intentionally been removed from the Tarokka reading. 

Several of these allies, such as Sir Godfrey Gwilym or the (now nonexistent) archmage Mordenkainen are too powerful and unbalance the scales in favor of the party. Others, such as Nikolai Wachter or Clovin Belview, are far too weak to provide meaningful aid. Others still, such as Vasilka, Pidlwick II, Sir Klutz, or Parriwimple, lack sufficient character depth to serve a meaningful narrative role.

Many of the remaining possible allies—including Davian Martikov, Victor Vallakovich, or Ismark Kolyanovich—have been removed as possibilities because their revised character arcs tie them more strongly to their families, friends, or homes. The final alternative ally, Kasimir Velikov, has been removed to ensure that the players do not seek him out—and receive the deadly Amber Temple questline—until they are strong enough to do so.

That leaves Ezmerelda d'Avenir. Selecting Ezmerelda as Strahd's Enemy reduces the number of NPC allies that the players can recruit, keeping the party to a more manageable size; provides the players with a clear hook to Krezk and the Abbey of Saint Markovia, which unlocks several additional quests; and ensures that the players are neither outmatched by nor overpowered compared to their ally at any point in the game.

***Strahd's Location.*** The location of the final battle with Strahd has been intentionally limited to **K20. Heart of Sorrow**. As the new centerpiece of Strahd's power and schemes, a perfect arena for tactical combat, and an area with clear views of the post-battle sunrise, the Heart—including its adjoining bridge and rooftop—is the ideal (and expected) place for the finale to unfold.
## Adventure Hooks

The original module's four adventure hooks are fundamentally flawed: *Plea for Help* tends to make players to resent Ireena Kolyana; *Mysterious Visitors* tends to make players feel deceived (and therefore regret accepting Stanimir's mission); *Werewolves in the Mist* reaches its climax too early; and *Creeping Fog* offers little setup or emotional investment. Most significantly, aside from *Mysterious Visitors*, no adventure hook leads the players directly and inevitably to a final confrontation with Strahd.

Custom adventure hooks that tie player backstories directly to Barovia (e.g., by allowing players to rescue a lost loved one) tend to fall flat for three reasons: they lack a direct tie to Strahd; they distract the players from the fight with Strahd; and they violate principles of verisimilitude (i.e., by making Barovia a far busier place than it deserves to be). Importantly, players receiving such hooks may struggle to understand the importance of Madam Eva's Tarokka reading, especially while they retain unfinished business in the valley.

However, a large subset of *Curse of Strahd* DMs nonetheless prefer tying player backstories to Barovia in order to promote player engagement and emotional investment in the campaign itself. To this end, the ***Barovian Relics*** hook provides players with reasons to journey to Barovia that will inevitably lead them to a direct confrontation with Strahd. Meanwhile, ***Lost in the Mists*** serves as a fleshed-out substitute for ***Creeping Fog***, aiding DMs who would prefer to keep Barovia as an eerie and alienating location.
