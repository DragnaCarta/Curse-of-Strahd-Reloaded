# Official Material
Consider *Curse of Strahd: Reloaded* your all-in-one grimoire for running this campaign. You'll only need to reference the original *Curse of Strahd* module when this guide tells you to do so, though you should feel free to read the original module to familiarize yourself with the bones of the campaign first.

> [!warning] **A Brand-New Barovia**
> *Curse of Strahd: Reloaded* is meant to be a complete substitute to the original *Curse of Strahd*, incorporating the original material only by reference. 
> 
> For example, if this guide says: "This area is largely as described in **E2. Blood of the Vine Tavern (p. 43)**", this means that you should use all of the material provided in that section of the original book, **except where it's contradicted or overwritten by material in this guide.** 
> 
> If this guide doesn't reference a particular element in the original adventure—such as a random encounter or a piece of lore—**assume it doesn't exist.**

As you read through this guide, make sure you have access to the following resources:

* the *Monster Manual*,
* *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*, and
* *Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft*.

When we reference one of these unholy tomes, you'll find the necessary citation in parentheses, formatted like this: <span class="citation">Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft, p. 66</span>. If you lack the required sourcebook, get creative with a homebrewed statblock or find a suitable replacement.

> [!warning] **Brewer Beware**
> The original *Curse of Strahd: Reloaded* was a highly modular guide, containing a number of distinct ideas, concepts, and challenges that could easily be extracted, applied, and recombined alongside a number of additional reworks or homebrew elements. However, this revision aims to take a more cohesive path, weaving together characters, narratives, and themes to forge a more evocative, dramatic, and memorable adventure.
> 
> As such, be cautious when removing, adding to, or changing aspects of this guide, as a seemingly innocuous detail may instead prove to be a load-bearing support. When in doubt, read the **Design Notes** for the relevant section and review the **Adventure Summary** below to confirm the context and purpose of the detail in question.
> 
> This danger is especially present when combining *Reloaded* with additional third-party *Curse of Strahd* guides or supplements, many of which have been designed for campaigns with different tones, narratives, or themes. Remember that each comprehensive guide to *Curse of Strahd*—including this one—has been written as a complete, integrated experience, and that weaving different threads together may instead cause the entire tapestry to fall apart.
