# Setting Expectations
Welcome to a world shrouded in darkness and horror, where secrets and conspiracies lurk around every corner. In order to fully immerse themselves in this chilling adventure, your players should consider these expectations when crafting their characters and preparing for the campaign:

* ***Tone***. Embrace the dark fantasy setting and create characters with heroic hearts or the potential to grow into true heroes when faced with life-or-death situations. Cooperation and collaboration will be key in this twisted realm.
* ***Theme***. As you explore this gothic horror landscape, prepare to allow your characters to confront their own regrets, traumas, flaws, and fears, enhancing the overall atmosphere and tension of the campaign.
* ***Engagement***. Prepare to delve deep into the rich lore and history of this world. Taking notes and engaging with the story will not only heighten your experience but also benefit your party as you navigate this intricate adventure.
* ***Tactics***. Tread carefully in a land rife with hidden allies and potential enemies. Consider the consequences of your actions and avoid making unnecessary enemies who could hinder your progress.
* ***Roleplay***. Be open to forming meaningful relationships with the unique and intriguing non-player characters that inhabit this world. Emotional investment in these characters will enrich your overall experience.
* ***Difficulty***. Death may lurk around every corner, but with clever thinking and strategic alliances, your party can overcome even the most daunting obstacles.
* ***Rewards***. While material treasures may be scarce, the true rewards of this campaign lie in the allies, information, and story hooks you'll uncover as you complete each harrowing quest. Experience points will be awarded for milestones achieved along the way.
* ***Narrative***. Expect the campaign to begin with a clear path but quickly evolve into an expansive sandbox. Balancing and prioritizing multiple quests will be crucial as you navigate the world's urgent deadlines and far-reaching consequences.
# Triggers & Accommodations
Our aim is to create a memorable and enjoyable gothic horror experience for everyone involved. To that end, it's essential to address any potentially uncomfortable or controversial topics before beginning your *Curse of Strahd* adventure. During Session Zero, we encourage open and honest communication with your players about their personal boundaries and any elements of the campaign that may require modification or removal.

A list of potentially uncomfortable topics you might want to discuss with your players before beginning the campaign includes:

* Child abuse and death (e.g., the Durst children)
* Torture and mutilation (e.g., Kasimir's severed ears)
* Mind control (e.g., Strahd's ***charm*** ability)
* (Implied) incest (e.g., the Belviews)
* Stalking and (symbolic) sexual assault (e.g., Strahd's obsession with Ireena)
* Suicide (e.g., Tatyana's death)
* Drug addiction (e.g., the dream pastries)
* Body horror (e.g., the vestiges' dark gifts)
* Racism (e.g., Barovian views of the Vistani)
# Campaign Contract
To ensure all players are on the same page when beginning the campaign, consider having each player review and/or sign the following "campaign contract" during Session Zero:

<div class="description">
<p>I, <strong>&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;</strong>, understand and agree to the following expectations:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>I will make and play a character who is—while potentially flawed—either (a) actively heroic; or (b) a sociable, cooperative character who inevitably and actively begins growing towards heroism within the first five sessions.</li>
<li>I will allow my character to feel true, powerless fear when faced with an overwhelming threat, and allow that fear to impact my character's actions, growth, and development.</li>
<li>I will make every reasonable effort to build meaningful short- and long-term relationships with NPCs, and allow myself to become emotionally invested in their lives and goals.</li> 
<li>This campaign requires alliances and cooperation with NPCs and other players, rather than paranoia or antisocial behavior.</li> 
<li>The DM will not try to trick me, and will give me a fair chance to avoid bad situations through clear foreshadowing.</li>
<li>This campaign will largely focus on social encounters, investigations, and exploration, and combat may occur as infrequently as once every two or three sessions.</li> 
<li>Treasure and magic items will be rare and infrequently obtained, with most rewards taking the form of relationships and alliances with friendly NPCs.</li>
<li>This campaign will take place in a "fish-out-of-water" setting, and elements from my character's backstory will not directly appear or be referenced in the campaign.</li>
<li>It is my sole responsibility to collaborate with the DM and other players to provide my character with an internal emotional character arc if desired.</li> 
<li>Some powerful enemies will be impossible to defeat through combat, and that we will need to either gain levels, allies, or resources in order to do so.</li>
<li>The DM has balanced any expected combat encounters to make a TPK unlikely unless we make poor decisions; should a TPK occur, the party may have an opportunity to "fail forward" and continue the campaign, albeit with severe consequences.</li> 
<li>This campaign has altered the statistics for many official D&D 5e monsters, and has introduced additional mechanics or altered statistics for other enemies to create a balanced, high-tension combat experience that may differ from the <em>Monster Manual</em> and other official supplements.</li>
<li>I will not seek out any information, artwork, videos, or other media relevant to Curse of Strahd, or any characters, locations, or lore within the campaign.</li> 
</ul>
