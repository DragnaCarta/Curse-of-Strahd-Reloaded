# Areas of the Tower

The following areas correspond to labels on the map of Van Richten's Tower below.

## V1. Ezmerelda's Magic Wagon

Ezmerelda's wagon is parked in front of the tower. If the characters investigate the wagon, read:

Under layers of mud, this wagon sports a fresh coat of purple paint, and its wheels have fancy gold trim. A brass lantern hangs from each corner, and red drapes cover a tombstone-shaped window on each side. A steel padlock secures the back door, hanging from which is a cheap wooden sign that reads, "Keep out!"

The wagon radiates an aura of conjuration magic if it is scrutinized with a detect magic spell. A character who casts an identify spell on the wagon learns the command words needed to operate it.

MAP 11.1: VAN RICHTEN'S TOWER (AREA V)

Anyone who sits in the driver's seat and speaks its command word ("Drovash") summons a pair of quasi-real draft horses, which are magically tethered to the wagon and can't be separated from it. The horses and wagon have a speed of 30 feet, and the horses heed the driver's simple commands. The driver can dismiss the horses with a second command word ("Arvesh"). The horses can be dispelled (DC 15) but not harmed.

The wagon has a hidden trapdoor in its underbelly that can be detected by a character who scuttles under the wagon and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. The trapdoor opens into the wagon and is the only safe way inside.

### Booby Trap

The inside handle of the door has a wire looped around it, and the wire is connected to a flask of alchemist's fire hanging from the wagon's ceiling. When the door is opened, the flask falls and explodes, igniting one hundred more flasks of alchemist's fire that dangle from wires like ornaments along the wagon's interior walls. A creature within 30 feet of the wagon when it explodes must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures inside the wagon or within 5 feet of it have disadvantage on the saving throw. The wagon is reduced to flinders by the explosion, and the contents of the wagon (see "Treasure" below) are destroyed as well.

A character inside the wagon spots the trap automatically (no ability check required) and can disable it with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. A failed attempt to disable the trap triggers it.

### Treasure

The interior of the wagon contains the following items:

%% --- Page 232 --- %%
- A wooden trunk covered with claw marks that holds a battleaxe, a flail, a morningstar, a light crossbow, and 10 silvered crossbow bolts
- A narrow wardrobe containing three sets of fine clothes, two sets of traveler's clothes, several pairs of shoes, a harlequin mask, and three wigs
- A climber's kit, a disguise kit, a healer's kit, and a poisoner's kit
- A lyre with golden strings (worth 50 gp )
- A sculpted wooden cage holding a chicken and a silver ewer (worth 100 gp ) with five chicken eggs in it
- A tiny wooden box containing a deck of tarokka cards (see appendix E) wrapped in silk
- A set of copper pots and pans (worth 50 gp )
- Three sets of manacles
- A shovel
- A wooden chest containing a gold holy symbol of the Morninglord (worth 100 gp ), three vials of holy water, three vials of perfume, two vials of antitoxin, a 50-foot coil of hempen rope, a tinderbox, a steel mirror, a sharpened wooden stake, and a spyglass
- Two spell scrolls (major image and remove curse)
- A map of Barovia (showing all the locations marked on this adventure's map of Barovia)
- A charred page from van Richten's journal (show the players "Journal of Rudolph van Richten" in appendix F).

## V2. Tower Door 

The tower door is made of iron, with no visible handles or hinges. In the middle of the door is a large, embossed symbol - a connected series of lines with eight stick figures set around it. Carved into the lintel above the door is a word: Khazan.

Show the players the door symbol to the right. The door is magically locked and trapped, and the symbol on the door is the key to disabling the trap. Magic that would normally unlock the door is neutralized by the tower's spell drain effect (see "Khazan's Spell Drain" earlier in the chapter).

A creature that touches the door without first disabling the trap causes lightning to envelop the tower. Any creature outside the tower and within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, with disadvantage if it is wearing armor made of metal, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one. As long as the effect persists, any creature that enters the lightning for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage. The lightning lasts for 10 minutes.

The third time this trap is triggered, the magic fails and causes the tower to collapse. Each creature inside the tower when it collapses takes 132 (24d10) bludgeoning damage, while those within 20 feet of the tower must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage from falling debris. The collapse not only destroys the tower but also most of its contents, including the animated armor in area V7. The wooden chest in area V7 (as well as the severed head inside it) remains intact but requires $1 \mathrm{~d} 8+2$ hours of digging through rubble to find. The clay golems in area V4 are undamaged but buried under piles of debris. Every hour the characters spend searching through the rubble, they have a 10 percent chance of accidentally unearthing a berserk clay golem.

### Opening the Door 

Each stick figure embossed on the door has differently positioned arms - either bent up or down at the elbow, or sticking straight out to the side. When a creature standing within 5 feet of the door uses an action to imitate the arm positions of all eight stick figures in the proper sequence, the trap is disabled and the door swings open on rusty hinges for 10 minutes. The lines of the symbol on the door reveal the proper sequence. The dance can be performed in one of two ways; a creature must trace the path of the lines, starting at either endpoint. All eight sets of arm positions must be performed, with no repeats, for the sequence to be complete.

If the arm positions are done out of order, a young blue dragon magically appears within 30 feet of the door and attacks all creatures it can see. The characters can keep trying to open the door while the dragon is attacking them. The dragon disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or if the characters open the door.

### Vestibule

Beyond the door is a 5 -foot-square vestibule with a tattered curtain that conceals area V4 beyond. The iron door leading outside can be safely opened from this side. It magically closes after 1 minute unless held open.

## V7. Tower, Fourth Floor

Unlike the levels below, this room shows signs of recent habitation, and although the place reeks of mold and mildew, it has plenty of creature comforts, including a cozy bed, a desk with matching chair, bright tapestries, and a large iron stove with plenty of wood to feed it. Light enters through arrow slits as well as through dirtcaked windows with broken shutters. Other features of the room include a standing suit of armor and a wooden chest. Old wooden rafters bend under the weight of the tower roof, which has somehow remained intact. Mounted to the rafters are pulleys around which hang iron chains that support the tower's elevator platform.

%% --- Page 235 --- %%
Van Richten spent several months in this room, reviewing a lifetime's worth of research on Strahd von Zarovich - notes that, once he committed them to memory, he burned in the stove. He also burned his journals. Ezmerelda searched the room, hoping to find a clue to her mentor's plan or whereabouts. Among the things she found here was a rolled-up map of Barovia and a burned page from van Richten's journal, which she took and hid in her wagon (area V1).

The standing armor is a suit of animated armor. It is incapacitated until someone speaks the command word ("Khazan") within 10 feet of it, whereupon the armor follows the commands of the one who activated it. If 24 hours pass without its receiving a new instruction from its controller, the animated armor becomes incapacitated until someone reactivates it. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, the armor falls to pieces and is destroyed.

A lavender aroma emanates from the wooden chest, which is unlocked and safe to open. It contains the severed head of a human Vistana named Yan. Its flesh has a waxy complexion and has been embalmed with magic oils. If a speak with dead spell is cast on his head (which would need to be taken somewhere away from the tower's spell drain effect), Yan reveals that he was banished from his clan for stealing. A half-elf bard named Rictavio offered Yan a ride in his carnival wagon. The two traveled together for several days, but their time together was tense. When it was clear that Rictavio was looking for a road to Barovia, Yan tried to steal the wagon as well as Rictavio's pet monkey, but Rictavio got the better of him and drove a sword through his gullet.

The magic oils preserving Yan's head allow it to remember conversations it has while under the effect of speak with dead. Rictavio has cast speak with dead on the head twice to ask questions about the Vistani of Barovia. Yan believes that the half-elf plans to cause great harm to the Vistani and begs the characters to warn his people. He doesn't know where his body is.

### Fortunes of Ravenloft 

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it's in a narrow compartment hidden in the wall behind the suit of armor. If the armor is activated and commanded to retrieve the treasure, it pulls the stones out of the wall, revealing the treasure beyond.

If the characters have collapsed the tower (see area V2), they find the treasure after $1 \mathrm{~d} 8+2$ hours of searching through the rubble. For each hour they spend searching, they have a 10 percent chance of accidentally unearthing a clay golem (see area V4) that withstood the collapse. The golem, which took no damage from the collapsing tower, is berserk and attacks until destroyed.
