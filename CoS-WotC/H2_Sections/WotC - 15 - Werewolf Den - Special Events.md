# Special Events 

You can use one or both of the following special events while the characters are exploring or resting in the den.

## Leader of the Pack

This event doesn't occur if the characters previously encountered and defeated Kiril's hunting pack (see "Pack Attack" in the "Special Events" section in chapter 11).

Every hour the characters spend inside the werewolf den, roll a d20. On a roll of 18 or higher, the werewolf hunting party returns, dragging a dead mountain goat. It's a meager feast, at best. The party consists of Kiril Stoyanovich (a werewolf with 90 hit points), six normal werewolves, and nine wolves. All the werewolves arrive in wolf form.

If the wolves can see evidence of an assault on the den (such as if the guards at area Z2 are absent or dead), the werewolves assume hybrid form. Kiril sends three werewolves up the mountainside to area Z8 to enter the den from above while he and the remainder of the hunting party make their way deeper into the den.

### Development

As long as Kiril lives, the characters can't negotiate with the werewolves. If Kiril dies and the characters have the upper hand, the pack is willing to negotiate with them.

If Emil Toranescu is present when Kiril returns, Emil is determined to kill his rival and become the new pack leader. If he succeeds, he allows the characters to leave the den unmolested but refuses to release the kidnapped children unless Zuleika is present to convince him otherwise (because she fears that the characters might kill her husband if he doesn't let the children go).

If both Kiril and Emil die, Zuleika becomes pack leader and cuts all ties to Strahd. The ordinary wolves leave the pack once Strahd becomes aware of this development. If the characters were drawn into Barovia by the "Werewolves in the Mist" adventure hook, the werewolf attacks on the Sword Coast

an end under Zuleika's leadership. If she is also dead, a young but fierce werewolf named Franz Groza becomes pack leader. He is vicious and treacherous, showing the characters no mercy.
