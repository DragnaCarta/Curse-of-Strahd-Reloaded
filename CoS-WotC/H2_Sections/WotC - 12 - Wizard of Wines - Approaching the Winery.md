# Approaching the Winery 

If the characters continue toward the winery, read:

Situated in the midst of the vineyard, the winery is an old, two-story stone building with multiple entrances, thick ivy covering every wall, and iron fencing along its roofline. The trail ends at an open loading dock on the ground floor.

A wooden stable of more recent construction is attached to the east side of the winery, next to the loading dock. West of the winery is a crumbling well and a wooden outhouse.

When the characters reach the winery, read:

You hear the rustle of dead vines all around you. Inhuman shapes emerge from the vineyard, their limbs cracking as they trudge forth through the mist and rain.

Thirty needle blights (in six groups of five) emerge from the surrounding vineyard and make their way toward the characters and the winery. The blights are 120 feet away when they first become visible, and they have a walking speed of 30 feet. Characters can either barricade themselves inside the winery, thus keeping the needle blights at bay, or stand and fight. If they stay outside and fight, druids and blights from inside the winery join the battle on the rounds shown below.

|    Round     | Creatures                                    |
|:------------:|:-------------------------------------------- |
| $\mathbf{3}$ | 1 druid and 24 twig blights (from area W9)   |
| $\mathbf{4}$ | 1 druid and 5 needle blights (from area W14) |
| $\mathbf{5}$ | 1 druid and 2 vine blights (from area W20)   |

The druid lurking in area W16 carries a Gulthias staff (see appendix C). If the staff is destroyed, all blights within 300 feet of it instantly wither and die.
