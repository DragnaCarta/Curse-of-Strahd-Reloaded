# Special Events

You can use one or both of the following events as the characters make their way along Tsolenka Pass.

## Roc of Mount Ghakis

As the characters cross the stone bridge (area T8) from east to west - possibly on their way back from the Amber Temple (chapter 13) - they are spotted by a roc that has survived in the mountains for thousands of years. The roc has a great nest on the top of Mount Ghakis to the southeast and feeds on fish in the nearby lake.

When the Roc of Mount Ghakis appears, read:

Diving toward the bridge is a creature of unearthly size - a bird so monstrous that its wings blot out the sky.

The roc attacks a random creature on the bridge, snatching up a horse or a mule, if one is available. Otherwise, it attacks a party member. It can't reach characters who hide in the guard posts at either end of the bridge. If it has nothing to attack on its turn, the roc lets loose a horrible shriek and flies back to its nest.

## Bloodhorn's Charge 

As the characters make their way along Tsolenka Pass, they encounter a beast that the druids and berserkers of Barovia call Sangzor ("Bloodhorn"):

The road ahead is cut out of the mountainside, rising steeply to one side and falling away on the other. Mist and snow greatly reduce visibility, and the howling wind cuts through you like a knife.

If no character has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher, the party is surprised. Otherwise, read:

A nine-foot-tall goat stands atop a crag above you, its gray fur blending perfectly with the rock of the mountainside. It lowers its head, and malice glimmers in its eyes.

Sangzor is a giant goat known for its supernatural resilience and evil disposition. Mountain folk have been hunting it for years. Modify its statistics as follows:

- It has an Intelligence of 6 ( -2 modifier) and is chaotic evil.
- It has 33 hit points.
- It has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
- Its challenge rating is 1 (200 XP).

The giant goat charges down the mountainside (using its Charge feature) and rams a character. If the attack hits and the target fails its saving throe- " is sent tumbling down the mountainside, falling 100 feet onto a ledge.

The goat flees if it takes 10 damage or more. The mist and snowfall prevent seeing anything more than 60 feet away. Once the goat is out of sight, it disappears through a cleft.

### Development 

A character who wears Sangzor's pelt can command the respect of the berserkers who inhabit Strahd's domain. They will not attack the character or that character's companions unless provoked.
