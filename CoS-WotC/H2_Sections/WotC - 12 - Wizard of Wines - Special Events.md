# Special Events

You can use one or both of the following special events after the characters have rid the winery of its current menace.

## Wine Delivery

After restoring the Martikovs to their rightful positions, the characters might ask them to deliver wine to the Blue Water Inn (chapter 5, area N2), the Vistani in the camp outside Vallaki (chapter 5, area N9), or the burgomaster of Krezk (chapter 8, area S2). A grateful Davian sets his sons to the task immediately. [[Adrian Martikov]] brings the three remaining wine barrels up from the cellar and sets them on the wagon while [[Elvir Martikov]] secures the horses. Adrian and Elvir make the delivery themselves, but they welcome the party's escort. If the characters don't volunteer for guard duty, [[Davian Martikov]] suggests they go along with the wine wagon to ensure its safety.

If the characters escort the wagon, check for a random encounter once for each mile traveled. The wagon is also watched over by two swarms of ravens that swoop down to attack anything that threatens the wagon or the characters.

### Development

The characters can trade the six barrels of wine for a much-needed treasure in the possession of the Keepers of the Feather or the Vistani (see chapter 5, areas N2q and N9i), or they can use it to buy their way into the walled village of Krezk (chapter 8).

## Wintersplinter Attacks

If the characters leave the winery and return at a later time before dealing with Wintersplinter (see the "Druids' Ritual" section in chapter 14), the enormous tree blight (see appendix D) is sent from Yester Hill to ravage the vineyard and destroy the winery.

The characters arrive to find the grapevines trampled and the winery in ruins. Wintersplinter's tracks are clearly visible on the trail to the south. Characters who follow the tracks catch up with Wintersplinter as the blight slowly makes its way back to Yester Hill.

The Martikovs narrowly escape the carnage and flee to the Blue Water Inn in Vallaki (chapter 5, area N2). [[Davian Martikov]] is crushed by the loss of the winery, and morale in Vallaki sinks to an all-time low as word of the winery's destruction spreads through town.

### Development 

Three days after Wintersplinter's attack, Baba Lysaga (see chapter 10, area U3) dispatches the seven scarecrows from Berez and orders them to take up positions in the vineyard, to discourage the wereravens from returning. These scarecrows attack anyone who crosses the vineyard or approaches the ruined winery.
