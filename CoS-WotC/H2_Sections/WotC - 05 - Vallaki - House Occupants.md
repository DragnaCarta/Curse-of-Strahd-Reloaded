# House Occupants 

If the characters explore a residence other than the burgomaster's mansion (area N3), roll a d20 and consult the following table to determine the house's occupant.

|   d20   | Occupant            |
|:-------:|:------------------- |
|  $1-3$  | None                |
|  $4-5$  | 2d4 swarms of rats  |
| $6-18$  | Vallakian townsfolk |
| $19-20$ | Vallakian cultists  |

## Rats

A house infested with rats appears abandoned at first. The rats are servants of Strahd and attack if the characters explore the interior of the house.

## Townsfolk

A house of Vallakian townsfolk contains 1d4 adults (male and female human commoners) and 1d8 - 1 children (male and female human noncombatants). Anyone who listens at the door hears chatter from within. Townsfolk won't willingly invite strangers into their homes, but they will speak with characters from behind closed doors or while standing in their vestibules.

## Cultists

A cult haven contains 2d4 Vallakian adults (LE male and female cultists) and one cult fanatic (LE male or female) who leads them in prayer or orchestrates ritual sacrifices. These cultists worship devils and consider Lady Fiona Wachter (see area N4) to be their spiritual leader.
