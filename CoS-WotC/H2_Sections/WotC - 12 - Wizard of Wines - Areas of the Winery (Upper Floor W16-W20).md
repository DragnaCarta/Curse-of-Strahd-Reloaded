# Areas of the Winery (Upper Floor W16-W20)

## W16. Loading Winch

This room has a wooden floor with a ten-foot-square hole cut into the middle of it. Looming over the hole is a wooden winch. Perched atop it is a man with wild hair, rotted teeth, and skin painted red with blood. He waves a gnarled staff made from a black branch and babbles at you.

The man is a druid (NE male human) who fights only if cornered. Otherwise, he tries to flee by dropping onto the wagon in the loading dock (area W2). He then looks for a place in the winery to hide. A character who understands Druidic can translate the his words: "Nature bows to my every whim, for I have the vampire's staff!"

A secret door in the north corner of the west wall can be pulled open to reveal a bedroom (area W17).

### Treasure

The druid wields a Gulthias staff (see appendix C), which can be used to destroy the blights in the winery.

## W17. Master Bedroom

This bedroom normally belongs to [[Davian Martikov]] but is currently being used by his daughter, Stefania, and son-in-law, Dag, while they raise their baby daughter.

This room contains a four-poster bed, its headboard carved in the likeness of a giant raven. A soft black rug covers the floor between the bed and the door. In the corners of the south wall stand two slender wardrobes with a tapestry of a church hanging on the wall between them. Beneath the tapestry sits a handsomely carved rocking cradle. To the north, under a window, is a plain desk and chair. Other furnishings include a wooden chest and a freestanding mirror in a wooden frame.

One of the wardrobes contains Stefania's clothes, and the other contains Dag's. The desk holds manifests recording wine shipments for the past century. A cursory examination of recent records reveals that almost all shipments are made to the following locations:

- "BV" (the Blood o' the Vine tavern in the village of Barovia)
- "BW" (the Blue Water Inn in the town of Vallaki)
- "K" (Krezk)
- "VISTANI"

Characters who check the oldest records also find entries for "S" (Strahd).
The wooden chest is locked, and the key is hidden in a compartment in one of the bedposts. A character who searches the bed notices that a knob on one of the bedposts is loose and can be removed, revealing the compartment inside. The contents of the chest are described in the "Treasure" section below.

A secret door in the north corner of the east wall can be pushed open to gain access to the loading winch (area W16).

### Treasure 

Inside the chest are 50 gp, 270 ep (each electrum coin stamped with the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich), and 350 sp. A secret compartment in the lid can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. It holds a gold locket (worth 25 gp ) containing a painted portrait of a beautiful woman (Davian's deceased wife, Angelika), as well as a pouch containing five 50 gp gemstones.
