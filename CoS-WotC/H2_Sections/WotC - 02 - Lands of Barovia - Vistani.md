# Vistani

The Vistani (singular: Vistana) are wanderers, traveling about in horse-drawn, barrel-topped wagons, which they build themselves. Compared to Barovians, they are flamboyant, dressing in bright clothes and laughing often. As much as they feel at home in Strahd's dreary land, they know they can leave it whenever they please and aren't damned to spend eternity there.

Vistani are silversmiths, coppersmiths, haberdashers, cooks, weavers, musicians, entertainers, storytellers, toolmakers, and horse traders. They also earn money by telling fortunes and selling information. They spend whatever they earn to support a lavish lifestyle, display their wealth openly as a sign of prosperity, and share their good fortune with family and friends.

Each family or clan of Vistani is its own little gerontocracy, with the oldest member ruling the roost. This elder carries the bulk of the responsibility for enforcing traditions, settling disputes, setting the course for the group's travels, and preserving the Vistani way of life. Vistani elders make all the important decisions, but whether by choice or because of their age, tend to speak in cryptic, flowing riddles.

Vistani families and clans are closely knit. They resolve disagreements through contests that end with reconciliatory singing, dancing, and storytelling. The Vistani are quick to act when their lives or traditions are threatened and are merciless when they believe they must be.

## Strahd's Vistani Servants

%% --- Page 34 --- %%
During one of Strahd's military campaigns, years before he became a vampire, a group of Vistani rescued him after he was wounded in battle. These Vistani not only nursed Strahd back to health but also delivered him safely home. As a reward for their generosity, Strahd declared that all Vistani had the right to come and go from his land as they please, and this privilege extends to the present day. Thus, Vistani can travel freely through the fog that surrounds Barovia, without fear of harm or entrapment.

Strahd honors his debt to the Vistani in part because he envies the Vistani way of life-the freedom they have to go where they please, their devotion to family, and their festive spirit. The courtesy he shows them is not simply a matter of honor but is also born from his admiration of them.

In the centuries since Strahd became a vampire, many Vistani have allowed themselves to be corrupted by Strahd, to the extent that they consider him their king. Vistani who serve Strahd are less lively and friendly than normal Vistani, and their hearts are poisoned with dark intentions. Strahd uses them to lure adventurers into his domain and keep him informed about the events occurring in lands beyond his reach. These Vistani will lie to protect the vampire, and they fear the consequences of disobeying him.

When it comes to sharing information about their dark master, Strahd's Vistani pretend to be helpful, but the information they impart is misleading at best and often deceptive. They readily tell adventurers that they have a potion that protects them from the deadly fog that surrounds Barovia. Although this is a lie, they attempt to sell their fake potion for as much money as they can get.

## Vistani Curses 

A Vistana, regardless of age, can use an action to utter a curse. The curse targets another creature within 30 feet that the Vistana can see. The Vistana can't utter another such curse before finishing a long rest.

The curse is a repayment for an injustice or a slight. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the curse. The saving throw DC is $8+$ the Vistana's proficiency bonus + the Vistana's Charisma modifier. The curse lasts until ended with a remove curse spell, a greater restoration spell, or similar magic. It doesn't end when the target dies. If a cursed target is returned to life, the curse remains in effect.

When the curse ends, the Vistana suffers a harmful psychic backlash. The amount of this psychic damage depends on the severity of the curse that was invoked.

The Vistana chooses the curse's effect from the options that follow; other Vistani curses are possible. All such effects deal psychic damage to the Vistani who uttered them when they end:

- The target is unable to perform a certain kind of act involving fine motor control, such as tying knots, writing, playing an instrument, sewing, or casting spells that have somatic components. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 1d6 psychic damage.
- The target's appearance changes in a sinister yet purely cosmetic way. For example, the curse can place a scar on the target's face, turn the target's teeth into yellow fangs, or give the target bad breath. When this curse ends, the Vistana it takes 1d6 psychic damage.
- A nonmagical item in the target's possession (chosen by the DM) disappears and can't be found until the curse ends. The lost item can weigh no more than 1 pound. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 1d6 psychic damage.
- The target gains vulnerability to a damage type of the Vistana's choice. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 3d6 psychic damage.
- The target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws tied to one ability score of the Vistana's choice. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 3d6 psychic damage.
- The target's attunement to one magic item (chosen by the DM) ends, and the target can't attune to the chosen item until the curse ends. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 5d6 psychic damage.
- The target is blinded, deafened, or both. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 5d6 psychic damage.


## Evil Eye

As an action, a Vistana can target a creature within 10 feet that the Vistana can see. This magical ability, which the Vistani call the Evil Eye, duplicates the duration and effect of the animal friendship, charm person, or hold person spell (Vistana's choice), but requires neither somatic nor material components. The spell save DC is $8+$ the caster's proficiency bonus + the caster's Charisma modifier. If the target succeeds on the save, the Vistana is blinded until the end of the Vistana's next turn.

A Vistana who uses Evil Eye can't use it again before finishing a short or long rest. Once a target succeeds on a saving throw against a Vistana's Evil Eye, it is immune to the Evil Eye of all Vistani for 24 hours.
