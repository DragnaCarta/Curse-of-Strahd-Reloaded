# Areas of Argynvostholt (Q37-Q45)

## Q37. Knights of the Order

The leaders of the Order of the Silver Dragon used to convene here.

Through the dust and cobwebs, you see faded war banners adorning the walls of a spacious chamber, in the center of which stands a heavy wooden table. An iron chandelier hangs above the table, which is surrounded by six high-backed chairs with wood-carved dragons perched atop them. Slumped in five of the chairs are

If the beacon in area Q53 has been lit, the spirits of these revenants are laid to rest, leaving behind their inanimate corpses. If the beacon has not been lit, add the following:

The corpses tilt their heads in your direction. One of them growls, "Why do you the living disturb the dead?"

The skeletal figures are five revenants. All five are lawful evil. They are awaiting orders from Vladimir (area Q36) and fight only in self-defense. The revenants wear broken chainmail that affords as much protection as leather armor, and they wield longswords. As an action, a revenant attacks twice with its longsword, wielding the weapon with both hands and dealing $15(2 d 10+4)$ slashing damage on a hit.

One of the revenants, Sir Godfrey Gwilym, is a spellcaster with a challenge rating of $6(2,300 \mathrm{XP})$ and the following additional feature:

Spellcasting. Sir Godfrey is a 16th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14). Sir Godfrey has the following paladin spells prepared:
1st level (4 slots): command, divine favor, thunderous smite
2nd level (3 slots): branding smite, magic weapon
3rd level (3 slots): blinding smite, dispel magic
4th level (2 slots): staggering smite

Characters who inspect the fireplace notice a shield-shaped patch on the wall above the mantelpiece. A magic shield once hung above the fireplace, but it was taken when Strahd's soldiers plundered the mansion. It now rests in Castle Ravenloft's treasury (chapter 4, area K41).

### Development 

![img-66.jpeg](img-66.jpeg)

Sir Godfrey can sense that the spirit of Argynvost isn't at rest and isn't happy that the order has been reduced to such a state. If the characters petition the revenants for aid, Sir Godfrey (speaking in a scratchy voice) relates all the information presented at the start of the chapter concerning Argynvost and the rise and fall of the Order of the Silver Dragon. Neither he nor the other revenants can help the characters in any meaningful way, however, because of the oaths they have sworn to Vladimir Horngaard.

### Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading reveals that Sir Godfrey is Strahd's enemy and the characters persuasively ask him for help, he offers to join the fight against the vampire. Fate has unlocked his memory of the love that he and Vladimir once shared, and the power of that memory drives Godfrey to help fight Strahd and restore the order's honor.

If the beacon in area Q53 has not been lit, Godfrey's decision incurs the wrath of the other revenants, triggering an armed conflict.
If the beacon in area Q53 has been lit, Sir Godfrey remains a revenant even after all the other revenants (including Vladimir) are laid to rest, except that his alignment changes to lawful good. Although Sir Godfrey is unaware of the tarokka card reading, he somehow senses that he must perform one final task before his spirit can rest with Vladimir's, and thus he agrees to help the characters face Strahd in Castle Ravenloft.

## Q40. Argynvost's Study

This room is a haven for dust and cobwebs. Three narrow windows allow slivers of light to illuminate bare oak shelves along the walls and a torn, padded chair lying on its side near a cavernous hearth. A picture above the mantel has been slashed, its lower half hanging down below the frame like a torn piece of flesh. An iron door set in the south corner of the west wall hangs open on one hinge.

Strahd's soldiers forced open the iron door that once sealed Argynvost's vault (area Q41). They also took every book in this study but one. (Many of the books taken from here can be found in Strahd's study in Castle Ravenloft.)

The sole remaining volume lies on the floor behind the overturned chair. Titled The Oath Celestial, the book has been partially burned, and its cover was slashed by a sword. Leafing through the crumbling book reveals that it is a devotional text for knights from a place called the Holy Empire of Valentia. Most of the knights who joined Argynvost against Strahd came from that empire - now lost beyond the mists.

### Journal Page

As the characters cross the room, read:

You hear the soft flapping sound of wings, but can't discern its origin. A single piece of parchment blows off the top of a bookshelf, spirals lazily in the air, and lands gently at your feet.

The sheet of parchment is the last page of Argynvost's journal, the rest of which was destroyed. If the characters look at the torn page, show the players the "Journal of Argynvost" in appendix F.

### Slashed Picture

If the characters study the whole picture above the mantelpiece, read:

%% --- Page 191 --- %%
The picture shows the mansion in better days, under clear winter skies with snow-capped mountains in the background. The top of the chapel tower glows like a silver beacon.

The picture radiates an aura of transmutation magic under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell, but the aura is weak. If the characters repair the picture using a mending cantrip, read:

The beacon in the picture flashes with a brilliant silver light, and the spectral form of a huge silver dragon fills the room. "My skull lies in the fortress of my enemy," it says, "displayed in a place of ill omen. Return my skull to its rightful crypt, and my spirit will shine here forever, bringing hope to this dark land." With that, the dragon's apparition fades away.

The spectral dragon isn't the spirit of Argynvost, but a spell-like effect. Once the dragon has spoken, the picture no longer glows and becomes nonmagical.
