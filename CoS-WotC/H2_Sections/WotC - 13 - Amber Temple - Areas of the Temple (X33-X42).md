%% --- Page 264 --- %%
Several of these amber-glazed rooms are located along the periphery of the complex. Each room contains two or more amber sarcophagi (see the "Amber Sarcophagi" sidebar).

### X33a. Vault of Shalx 

The amber door to this room is sealed with an arcane lock spell. The password to suppress the spell is "Shalx." A character can push open the doors with a successful DC 25 Strength check. The door (AC 15, 30 hit points) can also be smashed. If the door is reduced to 0 hit points, necrotic energy fills the 30foot cube directly in front of it. A creature in the area takes 22 (4d10) necrotic damage, turning to dust and bones if reduced to 0 hit points.

Adjust the following text if the creatures in this room have already been encountered and destroyed.

This room has walls of glazed amber, a floor of red marble, and a rough-hewn shaft in the center of its ten-foot-high ceiling. Three amber sarcophagi stand in alcoves, and above each sarcophagus floats a human skull wreathed in green flame.

Three flameskulls guard this room. They attack intruders on sight.
The shaft in the ceiling is 10 feet wide and 20 feet long, with abundant handholds. No ability check is required to climb it. The shaft leads up to area X6.

### X33c. Ghastly Vault 

The amber door to this room hangs open, and the chamber reeks of death.

This room has amber-glazed walls and a floor of dark green marble. Three amber sarcophagi stand in alcoves. Two feral humanoids with ghastly gray skin stare at you hungrily with three eyes-two normal eyes and a third lidless eye blinded by cataracts. Five more cling to the walls and ceiling.

### X33d. Breached Vault

The amber door to this room hangs open.

This room has amber-glazed walls and a floor of purplish-black marble. Two amber sarcophagi stand in alcoves to the west and east. A third sarcophagus that once stood in the north alcove lies shattered on the floor. Clustered in the middle of the room are four loathsome, hunched creatures. Each one has a single large, baleful eye.

The creatures huddled in this room are four nothics-former wizards reduced to this evil state by their mad quest for forbidden lore. The nothics use their Weird Insight feature to pry secrets from the characters. Although this power is wickedly invasive, the nothics don't consider their prying to be offensive, and so they are taken aback if the characters retaliate. The nothics fight only if one of them is accosted, or if the characters try to destroy the amber sarcophagi.

Characters who touch the amber sarcophagi are offered dark gifts by the evil vestiges contained within them (see the "Amber Sarcophagi" sidebar).

The beneficiary's voice becomes a low whisper, and its smile becomes cruel and evil.

The amber door to this room is sealed with an arcane lock spell. The password to suppress the spell is "Harkotha." The door is otherwise identical to the door of area X33a.

This room has amber-glazed walls, a black marble floor with red veins, and three amber sarcophagi standing in alcoves.

## X34. Wizard's Bedchamber 

A white marble bed stands in the center of this bare stone room, its mattress long since rotted away. Golden hawks perch atop the bed's corner posts. The room's remaining furnishings have been reduced to dust-covered heaps. Cobwebs cover arcane sigils carved into the walls.

The ceiling here is 10 feet high. The sigils that cover the walls were once wards designed to protect the room's contents from theft, but they have been bled of their magic and can no longer harm anyone.

### Treasure

The four golden hawks are worth 250 gp each.

#[[X35. Sleeping Guardian]]

#[[X36. Lower West Hall]]

#[[X37. Wizard's Bedchamber]]

## X38. Haunted Room

This room, once a bedchamber, is littered with broken furnishings. Scattered about the room are the remains of a bed, a wardrobe, two trunks, three tall candlesticks, a desk, a bookshelf, and several chairs. Torn-up books, old quill pens, and tattered clothes are also strewn about.

%% --- Page 268 --- %%
The ceiling here is 10 feet high. A poltergeist (see the specter entry in the Monster Manual) haunts this room and telekinetically hurls broken furnishings at intruders so as not to give away its location.

### Treasure 

A search of the room yields a wooden scroll tube containing an intact spell scroll of wall of fire.

Piles of treasure are heaped against the west and east walls of this stone room.

If the golem is visible, add:

A ten-foot-tall statue carved from amber in the likeness of a hawk-headed humanoid stands in a wide alcove to the north. Behind it, a crack has formed in the wall.

The ceiling here is 30 feet high and flat. The statue in the northern alcove is an amber golem (use the stat block for the stone golem in the Monster Manual). It attacks any creature that disturbs the treasure. The golem can leave the room but can't leave the Amber Temple.

### Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it's buried in a random pile of treasure (roll a d6).

#[[X41. Fissure]]

## X42. Amber Vault

A golden marble staircase with a black marble railing hugs the north wall as it spirals gently up a thirty-foot-wide shaft. Lying in the middle of the room are six rotting wooden crates.

The amber-covered walls are sculpted to look like tentacles that entwine around marble bas-reliefs of kings, queens, pharaohs, and sultans attended by myriad slaves.

The west, south, and east walls contain alcoves, and standing in each alcove is a tall, rough block of amber. Two wide cracks have opened up in the south wall, spilling rubble and shattered pieces of amber onto the floor in the southeast corner of the room.

The spiral staircase climbs 30 feet to area X30. See area X41 for a description of the cracks in the south wall.
Inside the wooden crates, buried in earth, are six vampire spawn created by Strahd from a dead party of adventurers. As soon as they hear intruders in the room, the vampire spawn burst out of their crates and attack, fighting until destroyed.

### Teleport Destination

Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 in Castle Ravenloft arrive at the point marked T on the map.

### Amber Sarcophagi

Characters who touch the amber sarcophagi are offered dark gifts by the evil vestiges contained within them (see the "Amber Sarcophagi" sidebar earlier in this chapter). Kasimir will know when he touches the east sarcophagus in this area that he has found the dark gift he seeks.

West Sarcophagus. The vestige within this sarcophagus offers "the dark gift of the Vampyr" to any humanoid creature of evil alignment that touches it. The Vampyr's gift is the immortality of undeath. If the dark gift is accepted, its effect doesn't occur until the following conditions are met, in the order given below. The creature becomes aware of the conditions only after accepting the dark gift.

- The beneficiary slays another humanoid that loves or reveres him or her, then drinks the dead humanoid's blood within 1 hour of slaying it.
- The beneficiary dies a violent death at the hands of one or more creatures that hate it.

%% --- Page 271 --- %%
When the conditions are met, the beneficiary instantly becomes a vampire under the Dungeon Master's control (use the stat block in the Monster Manual). After receiving the dark gift, the beneficiary gains the following flaw: "I am surrounded by hidden enemies that seek to destroy me. I can't trust anyone." South Sarcophagus. The vestige within this sarcophagus offers "the dark gift of Tenebrous" to any humanoid creature of evil alignment that can cast 9thlevel wizard spells. Tenebrous's gift is the secret of lichdom. This dark gift grants its beneficiary the knowledge needed to perform the following tasks:

- Craft a phylactery and imbue it with the power to contain the beneficiary's soul
- Concoct a potion of transformation that turns the beneficiary into a lich

Construction of the phylactery takes 10 days. Concocting the potion takes 3 days. The two items can't be crafted concurrently. When the beneficiary drinks the potion, he or she instantly transforms into a lich under the Dungeon Master's control (use the stat block in the Monster Manual, altering the lich's prepared spells as desired).

The beneficiary of this dark gift gains the following flaw: "All I care about is acquiring new magic and arcane knowledge."
East Sarcophagus. The vestige within this sarcophagus offers the dark gift of Zhudun, the Corpse Star. Zhudun's gift is the power to raise the ancient dead. As an action, the beneficiary of this dark gift can touch the remains of a dead creature and restore it to life. The effect is identical to that of the resurrection spell, except that it works regardless of how long the creature has been dead. After it has been used once, the dark gift vanishes.

The beneficiary of this dark gift takes on a corpselike appearance and is easily mistaken for an undead.
