# Fortunes of Ravenloft

The events of this adventure are part of dark twists of fate that a fortuneteller can discern with the cards of a tarokka deck. Before you run this adventure, you must draw cards from a deck to determine the following elements of the adventure:

%% --- Page 8 --- %%
- Strahd's location inside Castle Ravenloft
- The placement of three important treasures that can be used against Strahd-the Tome of Strahd, the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, and the Sunsword
- The identity of a powerful ally in the fight against Strahd

This card reading can make the adventure different each time you play it.
At some point during the adventure, the characters are likely to meet Madam Eva, the old Vistani seer (see chapter 2, area G), who can perform the same card reading for them. Characters can also have Ezmerelda d'Avenir perform a card reading for them, provided she has her deck of tarokka cards. Ezmerelda's cards are hidden in her wagon (chapter 11, area V1).

Appendix E shows all the cards of the tarokka deck and summarizes their symbolic meanings.

## Card Reading 

When you perform a card reading before running the adventure, write down the results for reference later. If the characters have their fortunes read in the adventures, do the card reading again, out loud for the players' benefit. Substitute the new results for the old ones.

When you're ready to begin the card reading, remove the fourteen cards with the crown icon (the high deck) and shuffle them. Then shuffle the remaining cards (the common deck), keeping the two decks separate. Draw the top three cards from the common deck and lay them face down in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. Then draw the top two cards from the high deck and lay them face down in the 4 and 5 positions, as shown below:

## Strahd's Enemy

Drawn from the high deck, the fourth card in the card reading determines the location of an NPC who can improve the characters' chances of defeating Strahd. (Some cards offer two possible results, $A$ and $B$; in such a case, you can pick the one you prefer or that better suits the circumstances of the adventure.)

Strahd senses that this NPC is a danger to him and tries to eliminate the threat as quickly as possible. This NPC, whoever it ends up being, gains the following additional action:

Inspire. While within sight of Strahd, this character grants inspiration to one player character he or she can see.

%% --- Page 16 --- %%
Each of the NPCs described in this section has a role to play in the adventure, even if that individual isn't indicated in the card reading. For the one so designated, however, the information in this section regarding the NPC's behavior takes precedence over whatever is said elsewhere in these pages; that NPC is extraordinary.

### Artifact (Joker 1) 

Look for an entertaining man with a monkey. This man is more than he seems.

This card refers to Rictavio (see appendix D), who can be found at the Blue Water Inn in Vallaki (chapter 5, area N2). Normally reluctant to accompany the characters, Rictavio changes his tune if the characters tell him about the card reading. He sheds his disguise and introduces himself as Dr. Rudolph van Richten.

The characters might think that Gadof Blinsky, the toymaker of Vallaki (area N7), is the figure they seek, because he has a pet monkey. If they speak to him about this possibility, Blinsky jokes that he and the monkey are "old friends," but if the characters ask him to come with them to fight Strahd, he politely declines. If the characters tell him about the tarokka reading, Blinsky admits that he acquired the monkey from a half-elf carnival ringmaster named Rictavio.

### Beast (Jack of Diamonds)

A werewolf holds a secret hatred for your enemy. Use her hatred to your advantage.

This card refers to the werewolf Zuleika Toranescu (see chapter 15, area Z7). She will accompany the characters if they promise to avenge her mate, Emil, by killing the leader of her pack, Kiril Stoyanovich.

### A. Broken One (King of Diamonds)

Your greatest ally will be a wizard. His mind is broken, but his spells are strong.

This card refers to the Mad Mage of Mount Baratok (see chapter 2, area M).

### B. Broken One (King of Diamonds)

I see a man of faith whose sanity hangs by a thread. He has lost someone close to him.

This card refers to Donavich, the priest in the village of Barovia (see chapter 3, area E5). He will not accompany the characters until his son, Doru, is dead and buried.

### Darklord (King of Spades)

Ah, the worst of all truths: You must face the evil of this land alone!

There is no NPC who can inspire the characters.

### A. Donjon (King of Clubs)

Search for a troubled young man surrounded by wealth and madness. His home is his prison.

%% --- Page 17 --- %%
This card refers to Victor Vallakovich (see chapter 5, area N3t). Realizing that the characters are the key to his salvation, he enthusiastically leaves home and accompanies them to Castle Ravenloft.

### B. Donjon (King of Clubs) 

Find a girl driven to insanity, locked in the heart of her dead father's house. Curing her madness is key to your success.

This card refers to Stella Wachter (see chapter 5, area N4n). She grants the party no benefit unless her madness is cured. With her wits restored, Stella is happy to join the party and leave her rotten family behind.

### Seer (Jack of Clubs)

Look for a dusk elf living among the Vistani. He has suffered a great loss and is haunted by dark dreams. Help him, and he will help you in return.

This card refers to Kasimir Velikov (see chapter 5, area N9a). The dusk elf accompanies the characters to Castle Ravenloft only after they lead him to the Amber Temple and help him find the means to resurrect his dead sister, Patrina Velikovna.

### A. Ghost (King of Hearts)

I see a fallen paladin of a fallen order of knights. He lingers like a ghost in a dead dragon's lair.

This card refers to the revenant Sir Godfrey Gwilym (see chapter 7, area Q37). Although initially unwilling to accompany the characters, he will do so if the characters convince him that the honor of the Order of the Silver Dragon can be restored with his help. Doing this requires a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

### B. Ghost (King of Hearts)

Stir the spirit of the clumsy knight whose crypt lies deep within the castle.

This card refers to Sir Klutz the phantom warrior (see chapter 4, area K84, crypt 33). If Sir Klutz is Strahd's enemy, then the phantom warrior disappears not after seven days, but only after he or Strahd is reduced to 0 hit points.

### Executioner (Jack of Spades)

Seek out the brother of the devil's bride. They call him "the lesser," but he has a powerful soul.

This card refers to Ismark Kolyanovich (see chapter 3, area E2). Ismark won't accompany the characters to Castle Ravenloft until he knows that his sister, Ireena Kolyana, is safe.

### A. Horseman (Joker 2)

I see a dead man of noble birth, guarded by his widow. Return life to the dead man's corpse, and he will be your staunch ally.

This card refers to Nikolai Wachter the elder, who is dead (see chapter 5, area N40). If the characters cast a raise dead spell or a resurrection spell on his preserved corpse, Nikolai (LN male human noble) agrees to help the characters once he feels well enough, despite his wife's protests. Although his f $^{\text {mimily }}$ has long supported Strahd, Nikolai came to realize toward the end of his life that Strahd must be destroyed to save Barovia.

%% --- Page 18 --- %%
If the characters don't have the means to raise Nikolai from the dead, Rictavio (see appendix D) gives them a spell scroll of raise dead if he learns of their need. If they're staying at the Blue Water Inn, he leaves the scroll in one of their rooms.

### B. Horseman (Joker 2) 

A man of death named Arrigal will forsake his dark lord to serve your cause. Beware! He has a rotten soul.

This card refers to the Vistani assassin Arrigal (see chapter 5, area N9c). If the characters mention this card reading to him, he accepts his fate and accompanies them. If the characters succeed in defeating Strahd, Arrigal betrays and attacks them, believing that he is destined to become Barovia's new lord.

### A. Innocent (Queen of Hearts)

I see a young man with a kind heart. A mother's boy! He is strong in body but weak of mind. Seek him out in the village of Barovia.

This card refers to Parriwimple (see chapter 3, area E1). Although he's a simpleton, he won't travel to Castle Ravenloft without good cause. Characters can manipulate him into going by preying on his good heart. For instance, he might go there to help rescue missing Barovians, or to save the life of Ireena Kolyana, who is very beautiful. The characters must somehow deal with Bildrath, Parriwimple's employer, who won't let the foolish boy go to the castle for any reason.

### B. Innocent (Queen of Hearts)

Evil's bride is the one you seek!

This card refers to Ireena Kolyana (see chapter 3, area E4). Her brother, Ismark, opposes the idea of Ireena's being taken to Castle Ravenloft, but she insists on going there once the characters tell her about the card reading. Ireena won't accompany the characters, however, until Kolyan Indirovich's body is laid to rest in the cemetery.

### A. Marionette (Jack of Hearts)

What horror is this? I see a man made by a man. Ageless and alone, it haunts the towers of the castle.

This card refers to Pidwick II (see chapter 4, area K59, as well as appendix D).

### B. Marionette (Jack of Hearts)

Look for a man of music, a man with two heads. He lives in a place of great hunger and sorrow.

This card refers to Clovin Belview (see chapter 8, area S17), the two-headed mongrelfolk. Clovin serves the Abbot out of fear and a perverse sense of loyalty. His job is to deliver food to the other mongrelfolk, whom he abhors. If the Abbot still lives, Clovin doesn't want to earn his Master's ire by attempting to leave, and he refuses to accompany the characters. But if the Abbot dies, Clovin doesn't have any reason to remain in the abbey, so he's willing to come along if he is bribed with wine. Clovin provides no benefit to the party without his viol.

### Mists (Queen of Spades)

A Vistana wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long. Seek her out at Saint Markovia's abbey, near the mists.

%% --- Page 19 --- %%
This card refers to Ezmerelda d'Avenir (see appendix D). She can be found in the Abbey of Saint Markovia (see chapter 8, area S19), as well as several other locations throughout Barovia.

### Raven (Queen of Clubs) 

Find the leader of the feathered ones who live among the vines. Though old, he has one more fight left in him.

This card refers to [[Davian Martikov]] (see chapter 12, "The Wizard of Wines"). The old wereraven, realizing that he has a chance to end Strahd's tyranny, leaves his vineyard and winery in the capable hands of his sons, Adrian and Elvir. But before he travels to Castle Ravenloft to face Strahd, Davian insists on reconciling with his third son, Urwin Martikov (see chapter 5, area N2).

### A. Tempter (Queen of Diamonds)

I see a child-a Vistana. You must hurry, for her fate hangs in the balance. Find her at the lake!

This card refers to Arabelle (see chapter 2, area L). She gladly joins the party. But if she returns to her camp (chapter 5, area N9), her father, Luvash, refuses to let her leave.

### B. Tempter (Queen of Diamonds)

I hear a wedding bell, or perhaps a death knell. It calls thee to a mountainside abbey, wherein you will find a woman who is more than the sum of her parts.

This card refers to Vasilka the flesh golem (see chapter 8, area S13).

## Strahd's Location in the Castle

Drawn from the high deck, the fifth card in the card reading determines the location of the final showdown with Strahd-the place in Castle Ravenloft where the characters are sure to find him. The first time the characters arrive at the foretold location, Strahd is there, provided he hasn't been forced back into his coffin.

### Artifact (Joker 1)

He lurks in the darkness where the morning light once shone-a sacred place.

Strahd faces the characters in the chapel (area K15).

### Beast (Jack of Diamonds)

The beast sits on his dark throne.

Strahd faces the characters in the audience hall (area K25).

### Broken One (King of Diamonds)

He haunts the tomb of the man he envied above all.

Strahd faces the characters in Sergei's tomb (area K85).

%% --- Page 20 --- %%
### Darklord (King of Spades)
He lurks in the depths of darkness, in the one place to which he must return.

Strahd faces the characters in his tomb (area K86).

### Donjon (King of Clubs) 

He lurks in a hall of bones, in the dark pits of his castle.

Strahd faces the characters in the hall of bones (area K67).

### Seer (Jack of Clubs)

He waits for you in a place of wisdom, warmth, and despair. Great secrets are there.

Strahd faces the characters in the study (area K37).

Ghost (King of Hearts)
Look to the father's tomb.

Strahd faces the characters in the tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia (area K88).

### Executioner (Jack of Spades)

I see a dark figure on a balcony, looking down upon this tortured land with a twisted smile.

Strahd faces the characters at the overlook (area K6).

### Horseman (Joker 2)

He lurks in the one place to which he must return-a place of death.

Strahd faces the characters in his tomb (area K86).

### Innocent (Queen of Hearts)

He dwells with the one whose blood sealed his doom, a brother of light snuffed out too soon.

Strahd faces the characters in Sergei's tomb (area K85).

### Marionette (Jack of Hearts)

Look to great heights. Find the beating heart of the castle. He waits nearby.

%% --- Page 21 --- %%
Strahd faces the characters in the north tower peak (area K60).

### Mists (Queen of Spades) 

The cards can't see where the evil lurks. The mists obscure all!

The card offers no clue about where the final showdown with Strahd will occur. It can happen anywhere you like in Castle Ravenloft. Alternatively, Madam Eva tells the characters to return to her after at least three days, and she will consult the cards again for them, but only to discern the location of their enemy.

### Raven (Queen of Clubs)

Look to the mother's tomb.

Strahd faces the characters in the tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia (area K88).

### Tempter (Queen of Diamonds)
I see a secret place-a vault of temptation hidden behind a woman of great beauty. The evil waits atop his tower of treasure.

Strahd confronts the characters in the treasury (area K41). "A woman of great beauty" refers to the portrait of Tatyana hanging in the castle's study (area K37), which contains a secret door that leads to the treasury.
