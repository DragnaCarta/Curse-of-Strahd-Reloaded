# Areas of Barovia (A-I)

The following areas correspond to labels on the map of Barovia below and on the poster map.

#[[A. Old Svalich Road]]
## B. Gates of Barovia 

Two sets of these gates exist: one west of the village of Barovia and one east of the village.

The fog spills out of the forest to swallow up the road behind you. Ahead, jutting from the impenetrable woods on both sides of the road, are high stone buttresses looming gray in the fog. Huge iron gates hang on the stonework. Dew clings with cold tenacity to the rusted bars. Two headless statues of armed guardians flank the gate, their heads now lying among the weeds at their feet. They greet you only with silence.

If the characters are traveling on foot, the gates swing open as they approach, screeching as the hinges move. The gates close behind the characters after they pass through. If the characters are riding in Vistani wagons, the gates open in front of the lead wagon and close when the rear one has entered.

The eastern gates don't open for people trying to leave Strahd's domain unless they are accompanied by Vistani. The fog chokes any non-Vistani that passes through the gates or skirts around them when they are closed (see "Mists of Ravenloft" earlier in this chapter).

If Strahd is defeated, the gates of Barovia swing open, and the road east becomes clear of fog.

### THE LANDS OF BAROVIA: COMMON FEATURES

Unless the text says otherwise, the following rules apply to doors, secret doors, locks, and webs in these lands.
Doors. A wooden door can be forced open with a successful DC 10 Strength check, or DC 15 if the door is barred or reinforced in some other manner. Increase the DC by 5 if the door is made of stone, or by 10 if it is made of iron. Decrease the DC by 5 if the door is made of glass or amber, or if the door is weakened in some manner (such as by rot or corrosion).

#### Secret Doors. 
If there are obvious clues to a secret door's presence, such as scratch marks on a nearby wall or footprints leading to it, a character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher notices the secret door. Otherwise, finding a secret door requires a search of the area and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

#### Locks. 
A creature proficient with thieves' tools can use them to pick a typical lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A typical padlock can be broken by smashing it with a bludgeoning or slashing weapon and succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check.

#### Webs. 
Characters can pass through ordinary webs, including thick cobwebs, without fear of being restrained or slowed down. A character can clear away the cobwebs from a 10 -foot square as an action. Webs woven by giant spiders are a different matter; see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5 in the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on giant spider webs.

## G. Tser Pool Encampment

The road gradually disappears and is replaced by a twisted, muddy path through the trees. Deep ruts in the earth are evidence of the comings and goings of wagons.

The canopy of mist and branches suddenly gives way to black clouds boiling far above. There is a clearing here, next to a river that widens to form a small lake several hundred feet across. Five colorful round tents, each ten feet in diameter, are pitched outside a ring of four barrel-topped wagons. A much larger tent stands near the shore of the lake, its sagging form lit from within. Near this tent, eight unbridled horses drink from the river.

The mournful strains of an accordion clash with the singing of several brightly clad figures around bonfire. A footpath continues beyond this encampment, meandering north between the river and the forest's edge.

The eight draft horses drinking from the river are used to pull the Vistani wagons and aren't easily startled.
If the characters are brought to this camp by the Vistani, their escorts remain at the camp and don't accompany the adventuring party any farther.
Twelve Vistani (male and female human bandits) are standing and sitting around the fire, telling stories and guzzling wine. They are intoxicated and have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Three sober Vistani (male and female human bandit captains) are resting in three of the four wagons but leap quickly into action if an alarm is raised.

Although the Vistani in this camp are in league with Strahd, they attack only if the characters provoke them with threats or insults. Otherwise, the characters are offered flasks of wine and invited to join the reverie.

If the characters linger at the camp, continue with "A Vistana's Tale" below. If they seem in a hurry to leave, one of the Vistani tells them, "It was fated that you would visit our humble camp. Madam Eva foretold your coming. She awaits you." The Vistana then points to the largest tent. If the characters head that way, continue with "Madam Eva's Tent."

### A Vistana's Tale

If the characters linger by the fire, one of the Vistani recounts the following tale:

A mighty wizard came to this land over a year ago. I remember him like it was yesterday. He stood exactly where you're standing. A very charismatic man, he was. He thought he could rally the people of Barovia against the devil Strahd. He stirred them with thoughts of revolt and bore them to the castle en masse. "When the vampire appeared, the wizard's peasant army fled in terror. A few stood their ground and were never seen again.
"The wizard and the vampire cast spells at each other. Their battle flew from the courtyards of Ravenloft to a precipice overlooking the falls. I saw the battle with my own eyes. Thunder shook the mountainside, and great rocks tumbled down upon the wizard, yet by his magic he survived. Lightning from the heavens struck the wizard, and again he stood his ground. But when the devil Strahd fell upon him, the wizard's magic couldn't save him. I saw him thrown a thousand feet to his death. I climbed down to the river to search for the wizard's body, to see if, you know, he had anything of value, but the River Ivlis had already spirited him away."

The Vistana storyteller doesn't remember the wizard's name, but recalls that it sounded important. If the characters haven't spoken with Madam Eva, the storyteller urges them to do so.

### Madam Eva's Tent

If the characters decide to see Madam Eva, read:

Magic flames cast a reddish glow over the interior of this tent, revealing a low table covered in a black velvet cloth. Glints of light seem to flash from a crystal ball on the table as a hunched figure peers into its depths. As the crone speaks, her voice crackles like dry weeds. "At last you have arrived!" Cackling laughter bursts like mad lightning from her withered lips.

Madam Eva (see appendix D) speaks the name of each party member and makes some reference to that individual's past deeds. She then asks the characters if they want their fortunes read. If they say yes, Madam Eva produces a worn deck of cards and proceeds with the sequence outlined in chapter 1. (If the characters don't want a reading of their fates, continue play using the card reading you performed before starting the adventure.)

Madam Eva might seem mad, but she is, in fact, cunning and sharp of mind. She has met a good many adventurers in her time and knows they can't be fully trusted. She wants to free the land of Barovia from its curse, and her fate is interwoven with Strahd's (see appendix D for details). She does th

vampire's bidding when called upon and does nothing to anger Strahd or bring harm to the Vistani. She never gives aid and never asks for any.

### Treasure 

For each Vistani tent or wagon that the characters search, roll once on the following table to determine what treasure is found:

| d20     | Treasure                                                                                                       |
|:------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $1-10$  | None                                                                                                           |
| $11-13$ | Sack of 100 ep (each coin stamped with Strahd's visage in profile)                                             |
| $14-16$ | Pouch containing 4d6 gemstones worth 100 gp each                                                               |
| $17-19$ | Sack containing 3d6 pieces of cheap jewelry worth 25 gp total and 1d6 pieces of fine jewelry worth 250 gp each |
| 20      | One magic item (roll once on Magic Item Table B in the Dungeon Master's Guide)                                 |

### Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is hidden in one of the Vistani wagons. Madam Eva grants the characters permission to search the wagons if they ask, and any such search yields the treasure.
