# Morgantha's Coven

The hags possess the shared spellcasting abilities of a coven (see the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the hags entry in the Monster Manual). If one or more hags die, the coven is broken. Morgantha tolerates her daughters only because they help her complete the coven. If one of them dies, Morgantha sets out to abduct and consume a human child so that she can give birth to a new daughter (as described in the Monster Manual).

Morgantha gave her coven's hag eye to Cyrus Belview, Strahd's disfigured manservant (see chapter 4, area K62), so that she could spy on Castle Ravenloft and keep an eye on the vampire. The hags are fearful of Strahd and respect his dominion over this land. For more information on the hag eye, see the hags entry in the Monster Manual.
