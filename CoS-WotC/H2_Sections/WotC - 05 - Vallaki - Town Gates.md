# Town Gates 

Three tall gates made of iron bars lead into town:

- The north gate is sometimes called the Zarovich Gate, or "the gate to the lake," because it leads to Lake Zarovich (chapter 2, area L).
- The west gate is referred to as the Sunset Gate, even though no living person in Vallaki has seen an undimmed sunset. A few abandoned cottages line the road outside this gate.
- The east gate is also known as the Morning Gate, or, as some locals like to call it, the Mourning Gate.

Heavy iron chains with iron padlocks keep the gates shut at night. During the day, the gates are closed but not typically locked.
Two town guards (LG male and female humans) stand just inside each gate. Instead of spears, they carry pikes (reach $10 \mathrm{ft}$. $1 \mathrm{~d} 10+1$ piercing damage on a hit). These weapons are long enough to stab creatures through the bars of the gate. The guards greet all visitors with suspicion, particularly those who arrive at night. If the characters arrive at night, one or more of them must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the guards to unlock the gate and let them enter.

If trouble breaks out at one of the gates, the guards there cry out, "To arms!" Their shouts are echoed across Vallaki, putting the entire town on alert within minutes. Vallaki has twenty-four human guards, half of whom are on duty at any given time (six stand watch at the gates, six patrol the walls). The town can also muster a militia of fifty able-bodied human commoners armed with clubs, daggers, and torches.
