# Random Encounters

The first time the characters enter a castle area that isn't otherwise occupied, check for a random encounter. Also check for a random encounter every 10 minutes the characters spend resting in the castle.

In most circumstances, a random encounter occurs on a roll of 18 or higher on a d20. To determine what the characters encounter, consult the table below.

Use the descriptions that follow to run each encounter.

## Random Encounters (A-C) 

### Barovian Commoners

A loud clamor fills the unhallowed halls of Ravenloft. Cries of "Kill the vampire!" are mixed with bold voices shouting, "Never again!" and "To the crypts!"

Angry villagers who have entered the castle brandish torches and pitchforks in a ridiculous display of force. Everywhere they go, they shout for justice. They follow the characters unless prevented from doing so. As long as these Barovians are with the adventurers, random encounters occur on a roll of 9 or higher.

### Barovian Witch

You hear a woman's scratchy voice calling out a name. "Grizzlegut! Grizzlegut, where are you? A pox on you, you mangy cat!"
Through the darkness comes a crone wearing a pointed black hat and a burlap gown stained with soot.

Characters can try to hide from the witch (who has darkvision) or catch her by surprise. This Barovian witch is one of the servants of Strahd dwelling in area K56. She is calling out the name of her black cat familiar, which has gone missing. If the characters confront her, the old bat spits at them and begins casting a spell.

This encounter happens only once. If this result comes up again, treat it as no encounter.

### Black Cat

The darkness lets out a demonic hiss as a black cat darts out of the shadows, trying its best to avoid you.

%% --- Page 67 --- %%
This familiar is searching for its mistress (a Barovian witch). It wants nothing to do with the characters but attacks if cornered. If the characters capture or kill the cat, this encounter doesn't occur again. If this result comes up again, treat it as no encounter.

### Blinsky Toy 

A Blinsky toy is encountered only if the characters are moving about the castle (not resting); otherwise, treat this result as no encounter.

You find a discarded toy-something no child could love.

The toy has a slogan stitched or printed on it in tiny letters: "Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!" Roll a d6 to determine the specific toy:

| d6  | Toy                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|:---:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | A plush werewolf stuffed with sawdust and tiny wood-carved babies. It has dull knife blades for claws and retractable teeth.                                                        |
|  2  | A smiling jester marionette with tangled strings and tiny copper bells sewn into its cap.                                                                                           |
|  3  | A wooden puzzle box, 6 inches on a side, carved with silhouettes of leering clown faces. The box rattles when shaken. A character who spends a                                      |
|  4  | short rest fiddling with the box can figure out how to open it with a successful DC 20 Intelligence check. The box is empty, with nothing inside to <br> explain the rattling.      |
|  5  | A faceless doll in a wedding dress that has yellowed and frayed with age.                                                                                                           |
|  6  | A vaguely coffin-shaped jack-in-the-box containing a pop-up Strahd puppet.                                                                                                          |
|     | A spring-loaded set of wooden teeth with fangs, all painted white. The teeth gnash and chatter for 1 minute when the spring is wound tight (requiring <br> an action) and released. |

### Broom of Animated Attack

You hear a scratching noise. Out of the shadows comes a broom, sweeping its way toward you as though held by invisible hands.

When it gets within 5 feet of a party member, the broom attacks.

### Crawling Claws

A mob of severed hands, their mummified flesh black with soot, skitters out of the darkness across the dusty floor.

The crawling claws gang up on one party member. During the confusion, one of the claws tries to crawl into the character's backpack and hide there. It makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score. If the claw loses the contest, the character sees the claw enter the backpack. If the claw wins the contest, it waits until the character takes a long rest before scuttling out to attack.

### Crawling Strahd Zombie

You hear the deathly groans of something vile.

The groans are coming from a Strahd zombie that is missing both of its legs, so that only its head, torso, and arms remain. It uses its arms to drag itself across the floor. The crawling zombie has 15 hit points remaining.

If the characters are moving quietly and not using light sources, they can try to hide from the crawling zombie.

## Random Encounters (D-S)

%% --- Page 68 --- %%
### Ezmerelda d'Avenir 

Ezmerelda has cast a greater invisibility spell on herself and is stealthily exploring the castle. Choose one character in the back rank of the party's marching order, and read the following text to that character's player:

You feel a gentle tap on your shoulder but see nothing behind you.

If the character who is touched by Ezmerelda reacts in an alarming or threatening manner, she hastily whispers, "Don't be frightened. We're on the same side."

Ezmerelda is hunting Strahd, but her efforts to corner the vampire have so far been thwarted, and she fears that she might be in over her head. If the characters don't ask her to join the party, she wishes them well and goes on her way (perhaps to be encountered again later). If they invite her to accompany them, Ezmerelda tests the characters' knowledge about vampires by asking them questions such as "Have you ever seen a vampire change its form?" and "Do you know how to counteract a vampire's regenerative ability?" Whatever their answers, she ultimately agrees to come along.

This random encounter happens only once. If this result comes up again, treat it as no encounter.

### Flying Swords

Out of the gloom flies a rusty blade, followed by another!

If more than two flying swords are encountered, the others aren't far behind. These weapons drift about the castle and attack intruders within range of their blindsight.

### Giant Spider Cocoon

A giant spider cocoon is encountered only if the characters are moving about the castle (not resting); otherwise, reroll.

A white cocoon is suspended from the ceiling amid thick webs and appears to hold something human-like.

A giant spider made this cocoon. Characters who can reach it can cut it open to free whatever is inside. Roll a d6 to determine the cocoon's contents:

|      d6      | Cocoon's Contents                                                                                                                                    |
|:------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\mathbf{1}$ | A wooden mannequin wearing a gown.                                                                                                                   |
| $\mathbf{2}$ | A Barovian witch (see appendix D). She screams like a wild animal and begins casting spells.                                                         |
| $\mathbf{3}$ | A Strahd zombie (see appendix D). It fights until killed.                                                                                            |
| $\mathbf{4}$ | A Barovian lunatic (CN male commoner). If freed, he cackles until silenced or until a calm emotions spell is cast on him. A lesser restoration spell |
|              | cures his madness, at which point he tries to flee the castle.                                                                                       |
| $\mathbf{5}$ | A dead Barovian that serves as host to a swarm of insects (spiders). The baby giant spiders (each one the size of a tarantula) crawl out of the      |
|              | Barovian's gaping mouth or burst forth from its distended belly.                                                                                     |
| $\mathbf{6}$ | A Vistana bandit (CN male or female). The Vistana knows the castle's layout and helps the characters until Strahd or more Vistani appear, at which   |
|              | point the treacherous Vistana turns on the characters.                                                                                               |

### Rahadin

If Rahadin was killed or captured in a previous encounter, this encounter doesn't occur. Otherwise, Strahd's mysterious chamberlain approaches quietly. A character whose passive Wisdom (Perception) score meets or exceeds Rahadin's Dexterity (Stealth) check hear him.

%% --- Page 69 --- %%
"The master wishes to see you," intones a grim voice in the darkness.

Rahadin directs the characters to a random location in the castle, determined by rolling a d6:

| d6  | Location                   |
|:---:|:-------------------------- |
|  1  | Chapel (area K15)          |
|  2  | Audience hall (area K25)   |
|  3  | Study (area K37)           |
|  4  | Tower roof (area K57)      |
|  5  | Wine cellar (area K63)     |
|  6  | Torture chamber (area K76) |

Strahd isn't actually at that location unless the card reading (see chapter 1) indicates that he is.
If the characters ask Rahadin to lead the way, he declines. If the characters ask for directions, he tells them whether they need to ascend, descend, or remain on the level they're at. If they attack him, he fights to the death. Otherwise, he doesn't leave until after they do.

### Shadows 

If one or more characters have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher, read:

You can't shake the feeling that something is behind you. When you look back, you see a shadow, tall and still, but nothing of its dimensions that could cast it.

If more than one shadow is present, the others are close by but hidden in the darkness. These undead shadows follow the characters but do not attack unless attacked first. They otherwise obey Strahd's commands.

### Strahd von Zarovich

Strahd makes a surprise appearance.

A crack of thunder shakes the castle, stirring the dust and cobwebs. You hear a voice: "Good evening."

Any character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score lower than 19 is surprised as Strahd appears seemingly out of nowhere. The vampire prefers to attack a surprised character, choosing the one closest to him. Otherwise, see appendix D for the vampire's tactics.

### Swarms of Bats

You hear a peal of thunder, followed by the flapping of tiny black wings. Suddenly, a dark cloud of bats descends upon you!

These bats are the servants of Strahd. They attack the characters without provocation.

## Random Encounters (T-Z)

### Trinket

One random character finds a lost trinket. Read the following text to the player of that character:

%% --- Page 70 --- %%
You kick something-a trinket buried in the dust.

To determine what the character finds, roll on the Trinkets table in appendix A.

### Unseen Servant 

A curious object drifts into view, as though held aloft by an invisible force.

This unseen servant was created by Strahd and is permanent until destroyed (see the unseen servant spell in the Player's Handbook). Roll a d6 to determine what the servant is carrying, or choose one of the options below.

| d6  |                                                                                                                                                               Items                                                                                                                                                               |
|:---:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  1  | A tarnished silver platter with a lid (worth 25 gp ). If a character comes within 5 feet of the servant, it lifts the lid, revealing a bunch of moldy scones. The first character to eat a scone gains inspiration. On later occurrences of this encounter, the platter holds a crawling claw that attacks the nearest character. |
|  2  |       A silver goblet (worth 50 gp ) filled to the brim with wine. A character who drinks the wine must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On future occurrences of this encounter, the wine acts as a potion of healing.       |
|  3  |                                                                                                                     A gold candelabrum (worth 150 gp ) with three branches, each one holding an unlit candle.                                                                                                                     |
|  4  |                                                                                     A purple silk handkerchief with white ruffled edges (worth 1 gp ). On future occurrences of this encounter, the handkerchief is smeared with fresh blood.                                                                                     |
|  5  |                                                     A crystal dinner bell (worth 25 gp ). The unseen servant rings the bell if the characters come within 10 feet of it. The sound attracts 1d4 hungry vampire spawn (see below), which arrive in $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ rounds.                                                     |
|  6  |                             A wizard's spellbook with a black velvet dust jacket over its stitched leather cover. The book contains all the spells Strahd has prepared (see appendix D). On subsequent occurrences of this encounter, the tome is a nonmagical leather-bound storybook worth 25 gp .                              |

### Vampire Spawn

If any character has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher, the party isn't surprised. In that case, read:

Creatures with pale flesh scuttle across the ceiling like spiders, their red eyes glowing in the dark. As they draw near, their cracked and bloodstained lips open wide, revealing sharp fangs.

These minions of Strahd-former adventurers all-creep along ceilings and drop down on unsuspecting prey. The vampire spawn fight until destroyed.

### Vistani Thugs

You hear voices with thick accents.

A small group of Vistani (NE male and female human thugs) claim that they were the vampire's captives, only recently escaped from the castle's dungeon, and they offer to help the party. In truth, they are loyal to Strahd and betray the characters as soon as he appears. If the characters accept their offer, the Vistani pretend to be the party's allies for as long as they remain with the party, or until Strahd appears. If the characters leave the castle, the Vistani accompany them, since choosing to remain in the castle would likely arouse the characters' suspicion.

#### Treasure. 
One Vistani thug carries a pouch that holds 2 d 8 small gemstones ( 50 gp each).

### Wights

%% --- Page 71 --- %%
The air grows much colder, and you can hear the march of footsteps drawing near.

If the characters are moving quietly and not carrying light sources, they can try to hide from the wights. These undead soldiers once served as guard captains in Castle Ravenloft. They still wear bits of tattered livery, and they attack the living on sight.

#### Treasure. 
The wights carry longswords that have the crest of Barovia worked into their cross guards. Each wight also carries a pouch holding 2d20 ep, each coin of Barovian mintage and featuring the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich.
