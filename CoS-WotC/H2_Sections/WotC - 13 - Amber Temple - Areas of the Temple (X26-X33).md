# Areas of the Temple (X26-X33)

#[[X26. Secret Alcove]]

## X27. Lich's Lair 

This fifteen-foot-high room contains the trappings of royalty: ornate furniture, exquisite rugs and tapestries, and decorative statuary. Everywhere you look are lit candelabras atop small tables. The beauty of the decor is undone by thick dust and cobwebs. Standing in the center of the room is a decrepit skeleton clad in tattered robes.

Red pinpoints of light burn in the skeleton's eye sockets. "Do I know you?" it asks.

The lich has fewer hit points than normal ( 99 hit points), doesn't remember its name (Exethanter), and has forgotten all of its prepared spells. It does know its cantrips. In its current condition, the lich has a challenge rating of $10(5,900 \mathrm{XP})$. A greater restoration spell restores the lich's memory and all of its spells. Another casting of the spell restores its normal hit point maximum (135).

If the characters restore its memory, the lich gives them the passwords to all the locked doors in the Amber Temple (with the exception of the door into area X28, where its phylactery is hidden). It also provides all the information pertaining to Strahd and the temple presented at the start of this chapter. If the characters think to ask, it provides them with the command words for any of the books in the library (area K30).

If the characters restore its body, it offers to escort them while they explore the temple. The other creatures that inhabit the temple don't threaten the characters as long as the lich is with them.

The lich defends itself if attacked and turns to dust if it is reduced to 0 hit points.
The lich assumes that the characters have come seeking knowledge and power. If it is inclined to help them, it tells them how the amber sarcophagi work (as explained in the "Amber Sarcophagi" sidebar). The lich has no alliance with or animosity toward Strahd, and no interest in challenging Strahd for control of Barovia.

The furnishings here are in poor condition and fall apart easily.
There are three secret doors in this room. The secret door to area X28 has an arcane lock spell cast on it. The password to suppress the spell is "Exethanter."

### Treasure

The lich's ancient, bronze-covered spellbook sits on a rotted divan, in plain view. Inscribed on its spine is a title: The Incants of Exethanter. The spellbook contains all the spells on the lich's list of prepared spells (see the lich stat block in the Monster Manual). The lich attacks anyone who tries to take its spellbook.

#[[X30. Preserved Library]]

## X31. Central Catacombs

These catacombs contain the moldy remains of the wizards who once defended the Amber Temple. Later generations of wizards who were corrupted by the evil of the temple smashed the amber sheaths covering the dead wizards' bodies and stole everything of value, leaving the formerly preserved corpses to rot.

You smell the horrid perfume of the ancient dead. Stone niches along the walls of these catacombs hold human-shaped amber husks, bones, and tattered shrouds.

If the characters enter these catacombs, add:

Tall, iron candlesticks stand in alcoves. Their candles ignite as you enter, casting flickering light upon the walls and causing the shattered amber to glitter.

The magic candles ignite when a living creature enters the catacombs and melt away if taken from the area.

### X31a. West Catacombs

More skeletal remains fill niches in the walls of this smaller annex, the amber husks that once preserved them smashed beyond repair.

### X31b. East Catacombs 

The niches set into the wall of this annex lie empty, except for a thick coat of dust.

No wizards were entombed here. This annex is empty.

## X32. Lower East Hall

The walls and ceiling of this great hall are coated in amber that glistens like fresh honey. Dust covers the black marble floor. To the north, the hall has collapsed, leaving a wall of rubble.

Many amber doors lead from this hall. Standing in front of the south door are three ugly women in tattered black gowns with brooms and black, pointed hats.

An earth tremor collapsed the northern part of the hall. Three Barovian witches (see appendix D) are trying to open the amber door to area X33a by trying different passwords, unaware that they could gain entry through the shaft in area X6. Frustrated by their lack of progress, they vent their rage by attacking the characters. The witches let loose their three brooms of animated attack (see appendix D) while they cast spells.

### Development

If two of the witches are killed or incapacitated, the surviving witch attempts to escape by flying away on her broom. Only the witches can use the brooms of animated attack in this fashion.

### AMBER SARCOPHAGI

An amber sarcophagus looks like a rough block of solid amber 8 feet tall, 5 feet wide, and 5 feet thick. Trapped inside the block is a sliver or wisp of utter darkness no more than a few inches long. The darkness is the vestige of a dead and hateful god-a shard of pure evil with shreds of sentience and awareness. The vestige can't be harmed or controlled, and it is immune to all conditions.

An amber sarcophagus has AC 16, 80 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying one causes the vestige trapped within it to disappear, leaving no trace. You choose whether it is banished or destroyed.

A creature that touches the amber sarcophagus forms a telepathic link with the vestige inside. The vestige offers the creature a dark gift. The creature must willingly accept the gift to gain its benefits. A dark gift is described to the creature in general terms; its precise game effect isn't revealed until the creature accepts the gift. For example, a creature that touches Fekre's sarcophagus in area X33a is offered the power to spread disease. That the gift grants the ability to cast the contagion spell is not articulated.

A dark gift functions like a charm (see "Supernatural Gifts" in chapter 7, "Treasure," of the Dungeon Master's Guide). A creature doesn't receive a dark gift if it is being manipulated or coerced, or if it declines the gift. Once it receives a dark gift, a creature can never receive that same dark gift again.

The instant a dark gift is bestowed, the creature receiving it undergoes a transformation, gaining a sinister physical trait or flaw, or one of each. Unless the text states otherwise, a trait or a flaw that accompanies this gift can't be removed by anything short of a wish spell or divine intervention.

Each time a non-evil creature accepts a dark gift, it must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature's alignment changes to evil. A character who turns evil becomes an NPC under the Dungeon Master's control, although the DM can allow the player to continue playing the evil character.
