# Areas of the Temple (X16-X25)

## X17. Upper West Hall

The walls of this twenty-foot-wide, seventy-foot-long arched corridor are sheathed in amber. The southern half of the hall is scorched by fire, and a charred corpse lies on the floor here, under a burned fur cloak. Several amber doors lead from this hall, and three arrow slits are cut into the east wall. Floating in the middle of the hall are three skulls wreathed in green flame.

Three flameskulls guard this hall, attacking creatures that enter. The flameskulls will not leave the hall.
The charred corpse is all that remains of a wizard named Jakarion, who came to the Amber Temple seeking power. The flameskulls incinerated the wizard.

The arrow slits look down on the temple (area X5).

### Treasure

Although the dead wizard's spellbook didn't survive, his staff did. It is a staff of frost. Imprinted on it is a fragment of the wizard's personality. The first character who touches the staff gains the following flaw: "I crave power above all else, and will do anything to obtain more of it." This flaw trumps any conflicting personality trait.

## X20. Architect's Room 

Dominating this room is a twelve-foot-tall model of a dark castle with high walls and tall spires. Behind it, tucked in a corner, are some ruined furnishings and a wooden chest.

In the months leading up to the construction of Castle Ravenloft, this room was occupied by the castle's architect, a wizard named Artimus. He built a scale model of the castle out of magically sculpted rock. Anyone who has seen the castle recognizes this replica for what it is.

The ceiling here is 15 feet high. A secret door in the south wall can be pulled open to a staircase landing (area X21).

### Treasure

The wooden chest contains an old map case in which Artimus kept floor plans of Castle Ravenloft, but the maps were lost long ago. The chest has a false bottom that can be found with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Inside the hidden compartment is a tome of understanding.

### Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it's hidden in the miniature castle. The characters must smash their way into the castle to reach it.

## X22. Northwest Annex

When one of the doors to this room is opened, read:

Torches in sconces illuminate a dining table in the center of the room. Covering the table is a magnificent feast that fills the hall with the rich smells of cooked meat, sweet vegetables, piping hot gravy, and wine.

The ceiling here is 20 feet high. Amber doors lead south to a hallway (area X18) and east to a shattered balcony (area X23).
The table is real, but the torches, the feast, and the chairs are illusions created by a programmed illusion spell that triggers when a door to the room is opened. The illusion can be dispelled (DC 17).

Hidden in plain sight amid the feast on the table is a green copper ewer embossed with images of dancing bears, elks, and wolves. The ewer, like the table, isn't illusory. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the ewer. If a character picks up the ewer, the illusions fade away (including the torches and their light), and seven specters materialize and attack whoever has the ewer.

### Treasure

Any poisonous liquid poured into the ewer is instantly transformed into an equal amount of sweet wine. Furthermore, a creature that grasps the ewer's handle can command the ewer to fill with 1 gallon of wine, and it can't produce more wine until the next dawn.

Many unscrupulous Barovians and Vistani would kill to obtain this ewer. Others would gladly pay for it or accept it as a gift.
