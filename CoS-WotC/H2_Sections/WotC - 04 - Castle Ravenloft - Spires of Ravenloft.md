MAP 6: SPIRES OF RAVENLOFT

#[[K47. Portrait of Strahd]]

#[[K48. Offstair]]

## K49. Lounge

As thunder shakes the tower, heavy beams groan under the weight of the ceiling. Three ornate lanterns hang by chains from these beams, each casting a dim glow. The curved west wall is fitted with three windows of leaded glass in steel latticework. A bookcase sits on the east wall between two doors. Plush, overstuffed chairs and couches are placed about the room. The fabric has faded with age, and the patterns it depicts are nearly gone. Lounging on one couch is a handsome young man whose attire, while elegant, is worn and faded.

The youthful man on the couch is Escher, a dashing vampire spawn to whom Strahd has shown favor in the past. Escher is feeling somewhat neglected of late and has retreated here until Strahd's mood improves. If attacked, he hurls himself out the window and lands like a cat on the roof of the keep (area K53). He leads pursuers right to Strahd, wherever the lord of the castle happens to be (and regardless of whether the characters are ready to face Strahd).

In conversation, Escher displays wit with a hint of melancholy. Beneath his arch mood is a dread that Strahd is growing bored of him and will lock him in the catacombs (area K84) with Strahd's other castoff consorts.

The leaded windows are fitted with iron hinges and can be opened. They can be locked from the inside, though they are currently unlocked. The leaded glass doesn't allow for much of a view. If a character opens a window and leaves it open, there's a 50 percent chance that a vampire spawn crawling around the outside wall of the tower notices the open window and investigates.

The books in the bookcase have no value and aren't much help to the characters. Some of the titles found on the bookshelf include Embalming: The Lost Art, Life Among the Undead: Learning to Cope, Castle Building 101, and Goats of the Balinok Mountains.

### Treasure 

On the third finger of his left hand, Escher wears a platinum ring engraved with tiny roses and thorns (worth 150 gp ). Around his neck, he wears a gold and ruby pendant (worth 750 gp ).

MAPS 7-10: SPIRES AND TOWER OF RAVENLOFT
Characters who stand outside the door to this room can smell a pungent odor coming from within.
If the witches in this room have not been warned that the characters are coming, the characters can hear their horrid cackling. If the characters open the door slightly, they witness the scene described below:

Green-glowing wisps of steam bubble up from a fat, black cauldron in the center of this dark, oppressive room. Surrounding the cauldron are several gaunt women in soiled black robes. These witches sit hunched on tall wooden stools, their tangled hair tucked under black, pointed hats. They take turns tossing ingredients into the cauldron, uttering fell incantations, and cackling maniacally.

If the witches know the characters are coming, read the following text instead:

%% --- Page 98 --- %%
Green-glowing wisps of steam bubble up from a fat, black cauldron in the center of this dark, oppressive room. Surrounding the cauldron are seven tall wooden stools.

The Barovian witches (see appendix D) that dwell in this area have sworn themselves to Strahd's service in exchange for arcane power. Seven witches are present when the characters arrive, minus any that might have been encountered and defeated in area K50. If the witches are expecting the characters, they cast invisibility spells and stand quietly in the corners of the room, hoping that the cauldron draws their prey inside. Although they prefer to attack at range with their spells, they can grow magic claws using alter self.

When the cauldron is touched by someone who also speaks the proper command word ("Gorah!"), it magically heats any liquid placed inside it and remains hot for 3 hours, or until the command word is spoken again by someone within 5 feet of the cauldron. Once the cauldron's property has been used, the cauldron can't be activated again until the next dawn.

Captured witches will trade information in exchange for their lives and freedom, and can be forced to divulge the command word for activating and deactivating the cauldron. They also know how to open the trapdoor in area K55.

### Treasure 

Each witch carries a potion of healing that she made herself. There is a 30 percent chance that a potion has "gone bad," in which case it's actually a potion of poison.

Not visible from the entrance is a small table behind the cauldron on which sits an opened spellbook, seemingly on the verge of falling apart. The book is evil. Any non-evil creature that touches it or starts its turn with the book in its possession takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage. The book contains the following spells:

1st level: burning hands, charm person, detect magic, find familiar, fog cloud, mage armor, protection from evil and good, ray of sickness, sleep, Tasha's hideous laughter, unseen servant, witch bolt

2nd level: alter self, arcane lock, cloud of daggers, darkness, enlarge/reduce, invisibility, knock, misty step

#[[K57. Tower Roof]]

#[[K58. Bridge]]

## K59. High Tower Peak

If the characters climb the stairs to reach the tower peak, read:

%% --- Page 99 --- %%
The spiral staircase finally ends at a five-foot-wide stone walkway that circles the shaft. In the center of the tower's highest floor, a fifteen-foot-diameter hole drops into the cold heart of Ravenloft itself. Cold air rushes up out of the shaft, sending a chill through you. Arrow slits line the walls, and aging beams support a steep, coneshaped roof. One beam and part of the roof have fallen away, leaving a gaping hole open to the stormy sky.

The hole in the floor forms the mouth of an enclosed shaft (area K18a) that descends 450 feet to the castle catacombs (area K84).

### Pidwick II 

Hiding in the rafters is Pidwick II (see appendix D). A character spots Pidwick II with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score that meets or exceeds its Dexterity (Stealth) check. If Pidwick II is spotted, read:

Something lurks among the rafters-a small, spindly man not much larger than a child. A flash of lightning illuminates his face, which is painted like a grinning jack-o'lantern.

Although he appears to be a petite man wearing face paint and a fool's costume, Pidwick II is actually a clockwork effigy of the real-life Pidwick, who lies entombed in the catacombs. The dark paint on his face is soot.

If the characters see Pidwick II in bright light, read:

It's obvious that you're looking not at a small man, but a mockery of one. This thing is not a creature of flesh and bone, but a construct made of dyed leather stitched and tightly wrapped over an articulated frame. You hear the soft tumbling and clicking of gears.

Pidwick II can't speak and doesn't have an expressive face, so he relies mostly on hand gestures and simple diagrams to communicate. He understands Common but can't read or write.

If the characters show kindness to the clockwork effigy, it accompanies them and tries its best to be helpful and entertaining. It knows its way around the castle and can serve as a silent guide.

If one or more characters are mean toward Pidwick II, its quiet resentment of them grows, and at some point when the group is at the top of a staircase, it pushes one of the offending party members down the stairs. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or tumble to the bottom of the staircase, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen.

## K60. North Tower Peak

If the characters climb the stairs to this area, read:

The stairs end at a dark and dreary room with manacles attached to the walls. In the middle of the room is a wood-framed bed fitted with leather restraints. At the foot of the bed rests a closed iron chest, is lid sculpted with an emblem.

A wooden ladder leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling. Thin streams of water drip through the trapdoor's rotting wood, forming a puddle around the base of the ladder.

The ceiling here is 9 feet high. The manacles are rusted and can be easily torn from the walls. The trapdoor in the ceiling leads to the tower rooftop (area K60a).

The emblem worked into the lid of the iron chest is Strahd's family crest. (Show the players Strahd's crest.) Cyrus Belview (see area K62) stashed the chest here for safekeeping.

### Treasure 

The iron chest is locked, and its key is with Cyrus Belview in area K62.
The chest contains a bejeweled gold crown (worth 2,500 gp) resting on a silk pillow.

### Teleport Destination

Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 arrive in the middle of the room.

### Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is inside the iron chest.
If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is standing next to the iron chest.

### K60a. North Tower Rooftop

A cold wind greets you atop the tower roof, its rain-slicked flagstones surrounded by a twenty-foot-diameter ring of stone battlements. The thunderclouds above suddenly coalesce into the terrible visage of Strahd. The face utters a ghastly moan as thousands of bats fly out of its gaping maw and descend upon the tower.

Characters who remain on the roof are accosted by ten swarms of bats, which arrive in 3 rounds. If the characters descend into the tower, the bats don't follow and instead fly into the high tower (area K59), descend its central shaft (area K18a), and roost in the catacombs (area K84).

The courtyard lies 260 feet below, and the roof of the keep is 130 feet below.
