# Approaching the Den

When the characters first approach the werewolf den, read:

Above the tree line, carved into the side of a rocky mountain spur, is a wide, torchlit cave that looks like the gaping maw of a great wolf.

One hundred feet above the cave mouth (area Z1), farther up the sloping mountainside and not visible from the cave mouth or its vicinity, is a rocky ledge (area Z8). A character can scale the slope to reach the ledge without the need for a climber's kit or ability checks.
