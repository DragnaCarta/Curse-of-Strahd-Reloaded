MAP 5: ROOMS OF WEEPING

#[[K35. Guardian Vermin]]

## K36. Dining Hall of the Count

<div class="description"><p>Dust assaults your lungs. A sweet yet pungent smell of decay fills this room, in the center of which stands a long oak table. A blanket of dust covers the tabletop and its fine china and silverware. In the center of the table, a large, tiered cake leans heavily to one side. The once white frosting has turned green with age. Cobwebs hang like dusty lace down every side of the cake. A single doll figure of a well-dressed woman adorns the crest of the cake. Suspended above is a web-shrouded chandelier of forged iron. An arched window in the south wall is draped with heavy curtains. Resting in a wooden stand by the window is a dusty lute, and standing quietly in the southwest corner is a tall harp shrouded in cobwebs.</p></div>

%% --- Page 87 --- %%
The wedding cake is over four centuries old, kept in its current rotten state by the will of Strahd. The toy figure of the groom from the top of the cake was cast on the floor long ago. A character who searches the dusty floor finds the figurine with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.

If the characters take the groom figurine out of the room, read the following if they return to the room at a later time:

<div class="description"><p>Billowing drapes draw your eye to the window, which has been broken outward. Scattered about the floor are chunks of the moldy cake, as if something had burst out of it.</p></div>

There are two explanations for the burst cake and broken window. Choose the one you think is creepier:

- Strahd smashes the cake and breaks the window to make the characters think something terrible has escaped and is now stalking them.
- Strahd's hate assumes a corporeal form, bursts out of the cake (the symbol of Sergei and Tatyana's love), and escapes through the window.
"Strahd's hate" has the statistics of an invisible stalker and tries to kill whichever character is carrying the groom figurine.

The room has wooden doors in the north and west walls, and an ornate steel door in the east wall (see area K35 for details).
The harp stands $61 / 2$ feet tall, weighs close to 300 pounds, and is fashioned of dark, stained wood carved with images of harts and roses. Its taut strings are made of gut.

A character who plays the harp and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check does well enough to summon the ghost of PidIwick, a short little man dressed as a fool, with a tiny jingling bell at the end of his pointy dunce cap. He asks, "Why have you summoned me from beyond the grave?" Regardless of the answer, he commends the character for playing well and says, "In my crypt below the castle, thou shalt find a treasure worthy of one so talented as thee! May it help thee set this troubled place to rest." If the characters think to ask him who he is, the fool replies, "PidIwick." If asked how he died, he replies humorlessly, "I fell down the stairs." If PidIwick II (see area K59) is with the party, the ghost points at the clockwork effigy and says, "He pushed me down the stairs."

With nothing more to add, the ghost of PidIwick fades away and doesn't appear again. If the characters attack the ghost, it attacks them in turn.

### Treasure 

The lute, though old and covered in dust, has survived the passage of time. It is a magic instrument of the bards called a Doss lute.

## K37. Study

<div class="description"><p>A blazing hearth fire fills this room with rolling waves of red and amber light. The walls are lined with ancient books and tomes, their leather covers well oiled and preserved through careful use. All is in order here. The stone floor is concealed beneath a thick, luxurious rug. In the center of the room is a large, low table, waxed and polished to a mirrored finish. Even the poker in its stand next to the blazing fireplace is polished. Large, overstuffed divans and couches are arranged about the room. Two chairs of burgundy-colored wood with padded leather seats and back cushions face the hearth. A huge painting hangs over the mantelpiece in a heavy, gilded frame. The rolling firelight illuminates the carefully rendered portrait. It is an exact likeness of Ireena Kolyana.</p></div>

This chamber has several exits, including a large set of double doors in the west wall, a door at each end of the north wall, and a door to the south.
The painting above the fireplace depicts Tatyana, a beautiful young woman with auburn hair. Strahd commissioned the painting over four centuries ago to impress his beloved. The fact that Ireena Kolyana looks exactly like Tatyana is proof to Strahd that both women were born with the same soul.

The back wall of the fireplace contains a secret door, which is opened by lifting the poker from its stand. The fire must be extinguished in order for anyone to reach the secret door safely. Otherwise, a creature that enters the fireplace for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire. Until someone takes an action to douse the flames on the creature, it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. (This fire damage is cumulative with the damage from standing in the fireplace.)

The secret door provides access to area K38.

### Treasure

%% --- Page 88 --- %%
The real treasure here is Strahd's collection of books-over one thousand unique tomes in all. The collection is worth 80,000 gp. Transporting it would be a challenge.

Roll a d12 and consult the following table to determine the subject matter of a randomly chosen book.

### Teleport Destination 

Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 arrive in front of the painting of Tatyana.

### Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is resting on the mantelpiece under the portrait of Tatyana.

If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is sitting back in one of the overstuffed chairs, staring into the fire.

## K38. False Treasury 

Resting on the floor of this smoke-filled room is a closed chest surrounded by piles of gold, silver, and copper coins. The fittings and clawed feet on the chest are evidence of great workmanship.

Attached to the east wall are two torch sconces. The southernmost one holds a torch with an intricate metal base. The other is empty. A skeleton in broken plate armor lies against the wall. The skeleton's right hand is on its throat, and its left hand holds the matching torch from the empty sconce.

The coins scattered around the trapped chest total $50 \mathrm{gp}, 100 \mathrm{sp}$, and $2,000 \mathrm{cp}$. The chest weighs 40 pounds and is unlocked. When opened, it releases a cloud of sleeping gas that fills the room. Any creature in the room must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 4 hours. If all the characters succumb to the gas, they are found by the witches who lair in area K56 and dragged to area K50, then left there unharmed. If even one character resists the effect of the gas, the witches do not appear.

The armored skeleton on the floor is all that remains of an adventurer. His corpse has nothing of value.

### Secret Doors

This room is concealed behind two secret doors.
The secret door to the west is set into the back wall of the fireplace (area K37) and can be pulled open from within this room by lifting a simple locking mechanism (which is connected to the poker in the study). It's possible that a character might open this secret door inadvertently by lifting the poker in area K37. Characters can otherwise locate the secret door normally, but a successful check doesn't reveal the mechanism to open it. That can be found only through trial and error, or the characters can bypass the mechanism with a knock spell or similar magic.

The secret door at the northern end of the east wall is sealed shut. If the torch is taken from the skeleton's hand and placed back in the empty sconce, the secret door swings inward, revealing area K39 beyond. Removing the torch from its sconce at any time causes the secret door to close and lock shut, becoming sealed as before. Characters can locate this secret door normally, but a successful check doesn't reveal the mechanism to open it. That can be found only through trial and error, or the characters can bypass the mechanism with a knock spell or similar magic.

## K39. Hall of Webs

This ancient hall is choked with spider webs broken by a single clear path down its center.

The hall has an arched ceiling 20 feet overhead, hidden behind thick webbing. At the eastern end are a pair of arched bronze doors of ornate design. These doors can be pulled open to reveal area K40 beyond.

Most of the hall is full of giant spider webs (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Characters who stray from the unobstructed path through the webs risk becoming stuck.

### Secret Doors

At the west end of the hall are two secret doors.
The secret door on the west wall can't be opened from this side, except by magic (such as a knock spell). See area K38 for more information on this secret door. If the characters pass through this door coming from area K38, it closes and locks behind them if they don't take measures to prop it open.

A narrow secret door at the western end of the south wall is hidden behind a mass of webs. If these webs are cleared away, characters can search for the secret door, finding it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The door can be pulled open to reveal area K31b.

#[[K40. Belfry]]

## K41. Treasury 

This octagonal vault is free of dust and cobwebs. The domed ceiling forty feet above is painted black and sparkles with a display of stars in unfamiliar constellations. Barely contained within this vault is a square tower, twenty feet on a side and thirty feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlemented roof.

The domed ceiling is coated with dry pitch. The "stars" are shards of glowing crystal embedded in the pitch, each one as bright as a candle flame. Thanks to the starry "night sky," the vault is dimly lit.

The plundered riches of Strahd's secret hoard lie within this adamantine tower, which is actually a Daern's instant fortress (see chapter 7, "Treasure," of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Only Strahd knows the command word to alter its shape and size, which can't be done until every bit of treasure inside it is removed. Only Strahd can open the two means of entry: a sealed adamantine door set into the base of the tower on the north side, and an adamantine trapdoor on the roof.

The arrow slits of the tower are 4 inches wide and 2 feet tall, and the walls of the fortress are 3 inches thick. Characters who are able to reduce their size or assume gaseous form can enter the tower through these slits.

### Treasure

The ground floor of the Daern's instant fortress contains 50,000 cp, 10,000 sp, 10,000 gp, 1,000 pp, 15 assorted gems ( 100 gp each), and a +2 shield emblazoned with a stylized silver dragon that is the emblem of the Order of the Silver Dragon (see chapter 7). The shield whispers warnings to its bearer, granting a +2 bonus to initiative if the bearer isn't incapacitated.

The upper floor of the tower contains 10 pieces of jewelry ( 250 gp each) in a red velvet sack, an alchemy jug, a helm of brilliance, a rod of the pact keeper, +1 , and an unlocked wooden coffer with four compartments, each one containing a potion of greater healing.

### Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is lying atop the coins on the ground floor inside the tower.
If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is perched atop the tower.

#[[K42. King's Bedchamber]]

## K43. Bath Chamber 

Red satin curtains hang in archways at both ends of the south wall in this dark room. Between them, in the center of the chamber, stands a large, ornate iron tub with clawed feet. The tub is full of blood.

Both curtained archways lead to area K44.

### Tormented Spirit

The spirit of Varushka, a maid, haunts this chamber. She took her own life when Strahd began feeding on her, denying him the chance to turn her into a vampire spawn.

The blood in the tub isn't real, but rather a manifestation of Varushka's tormented spirit. If the blood is disturbed in any way, read:

A blood-drenched creature explodes out of the tub and attaches to the ceiling, cackling maniacally. Blood pours off its pale flesh, bony limbs, and stringy hair as it scuttles away.

%% --- Page 92 --- %%
The creature that erupts from the tub is no more real than the blood. It can't be harmed and doesn't attack. It scuttles across the ceiling, disappearing into area K44 through one of the archways. Once there, it disappears.
