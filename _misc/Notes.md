2. "This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope." - Look for a den of wolves in the hills overlooking a mountain lake. The treasure belongs to mother night. 
3. "This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight." - What you seek lies in a pile of treasure, beyond a set of amber doors. 
4. "This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness." - A Vistana wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long. Seek her our at Saint Markovia's abbey, near the mists. 
5. "Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. When the hour of judgment arrives, this card will lead you to him!" - Look to great heights. From the beating heart of the castle. He waits nearby.
