The party found themselves in a clearing covered by the canopy of tress where a trapdoor led down into the earth. 
* Going down the ladder the party found themselves in the Martikovs' refuge where they met Davian, Adrian, Elvir, Stefania, Dag, and the children Claudiu, Martin, and Viggo. Davian told the party the winery had been taken over by the Forest Folk for unknown reasons, and requested their assistance.

* Davian informs the party an emergency cache is located in the winery that they are free to use if found. 
* The party followed the underground tunnel to reach the winery where Brown Mold blocked the path inside.

* Party ascended the southern stairs of the cellar to the workshop. Fel scouted ahead while the others waited. 
* Fel made his way through the Fermentation Vats and up the western staircase without alerting the druid naturalist on the upper balcony. He heard an interrogation occuring on the balcony. 
* Fel noticed movement and noise from the room at the end of the hallway leading from the western staircase on the upper floor, and could tell there was another group of enemies on the other side of the eastern wall. 
* Igor and Fel were in constant communication using Message, so the remainder of the party met up with Fel at this point in the upper level. 
* The party battled the Druid Assailant and Vine Blight in the Printing Press. 
* The party battled the Druid Naturalist in the upper balcony of the Fermentation Vats. They surprised the druid and blights, and did not hesitate before starting combat, so no dialogue took place. 

# 21 JUN 2025
* The party released the trapped swarms of ravens hanging from the rafters of the fermentation room. One swarm of ravens remained to assist the party as they cleared the remainder of the winery. 
* The party moved directly to W16. Loading Winch where Lorghoth was waiting. The party received his information and began combat. 
* The party defeated Lorghoth and immediately broke the Gulthias Staff destroying the cutting of the Gulthias tree and all blights surrounding the winery. 
* The Martikovs' returned to the winery as the party finished a ritually cast healing spell. Thonk retrieved the cache of supplies in the storage room. 
* Davian Martikov shared his information with the party, most importantly that
	* The Martikovs' are members of the Keepers of the Feather, 
	* Three green gemstones have been the source of the winerys ability to grow grapes. 
		* the first was stolen 10 years ago, and Davian blames Urwin for not keeping watch, 
		* the second was stolen three weeks ago by Baba Lysagas' scarecrows, 
		* the last was stolen five days ago by the Forest Folk, 
		* and the Forest Folk seem to have attacked the winery looking for the first gem, not knowing it had been stolen already years prior. 
* Davain requests the party
	* travel to Yester Hill before dawn, 
	* recover the stolen gemstone, 
	* defeat the druids. 
* Davian offers the permanent help of the Keepers of the Feather if they succeed. 
* The party accepted and took a Long Rest at the winery. 
* Muriel Vinshaw woke the party a couple of hours before dawn and began travelling toward Yester Hill. 
* Muriel asked the party to make a quick stop to meet with an "informant" on the way. 
* Muriel led the party to Kavans' Cairn, where the spirit of a long dead Mountain Folk clansmen greeted them. Kavan gave the party some intelligence, namely,
	* The druids have a new leader: a dark-skinned woman clad in a white gown and golden tiara with a pair of sharp fangs, 
	* the druids recently obtained a gemstone that once belonged to Kavans' people thought lost long ago. The druids constructed an effigy atop Yester Hill, and placed the gemstone in the statues chest, 
	* the ritual seems to be to instill the power of the gemstone within the statue, woven with the roots of the Gulthias Tree atop the hill. 
	* the Gulthias Tree is a dark entity, and accomplice to the druids will, and may attempt to obstruct the party, but radiance burns it and slows its growth, and cursed blood strengthens it, 
	* there are more than a dozen druids and berserkers atop Yester Hill, and they are waiting for the "Shadowed Lord",
	* Disrupting the ritual, perhaps by removing the gemstone from the statue before the ritual is complete, will likely kill any surviving ritualists. 
* During their conversation with Kavan, he notices "something" watching from the shadows, and it vanished as quick as it was noticed. 
* Kavan asks the players to retrieve the wand held by an elder druid named "Svarog" and return it to him, if done he promises "I shall tell you where you may find a weapon of great strength to aid you in your fight". 
* The party departed Kavans' cairn, and were met by Strahd riding his Nightmare along the road. 
# 29 JUN 2025
* The party greeted Strahd as he approached along the road toward Yester Hill after departing Kavans' Cairn. Igor noticed that Strahd did infact know Muriel when he feigned surprised. 
* The party agreed to walk alongside Strahd toward Yester Hill where they spoke about his steed, their dinner invitation, and Kavan. 
* The party "convinced" Strahd to let them fight to stop the druids of Yester Hill, and Strahd offered a wager: if they succeed, meet him by the Whispering Wall to the west of Yester Hill, where he will offer a gift, and share a secret. 
* The party made it to the base of Yester Hill where Strahd departed. The party moved along the treeline and up the eastern side of the hill toward the top. Fel used the invisibility powder to conceal the party, and they all moved inside the circle of boulders surrounding the top of the hill from the north entrance. 
* Fel was able to move around the inner perimeter of the boulder circle toward the statue of Strahd, which holds the gemstone in its chest. The remainder of the party was discovered by Strahd as they attempted to move past the north entrance. 
* The party save Fel uncloaked and began a conversation with Strahd and Ludmilla, while Fel moved toward the statue. The party noticed Strahd toying with a pawn chess piece in his hands during their conversations. 
* Strahd vanished and Ludmilla began a conversation with the party where she shared her recent research endeavor - torturing and disecting what turned out to be a wereraven, and how she brokered an alliance between Baba Lysaga and the druids of Yester Hill. 
* The ritual, and combat, began. The party made quick work of the forward guards before Ludmilla moved toward the ritual circle and created a cylinder of mist, obscuring sight from both sides. After seeing a member of the party move through the mist, Svarog, erected a wall of thorny roots around the ritual circle. 
* As it stands, Fel remains hidden at the chest of the effigy preparing to break the gemstone free, while the remainder of the party battles Ludmilla and company beyond the roots and mist. 
* Ludmilla about to provoke Muriel into wereraven form. 
# 13 JUL 2025
* The party finished the encounter with Ludmilla and the Druids of Yester Hill. Fel took the gemstone from the statues chest and disrupted the ritual.
* Ludmilla used Dimension Door to leave once the ritual was disrupted. 
* Strahd appeared and beckoned the party toward the whispering wall. 
* The party met with Davian and the Martikovs. Davian spilled all the beans and the party received the ravens whistle. 
* The party took Strahds offer to venture inside the whispering wall. Upon the parties return Strahd gave them the Twilight Crest, two gray gemstones (locate object), one silver gemstone (misty step). 
# 2 AUG 2025

* The party joined the Martikov sons as they delivered a shipment of wine to Krezk, and were met by Baron Dmitri Krezkov. The Baron graciously allowed them entry into the village for their assistance in restoring the flow of wine to the village. The Baron spoke with the party regarding his family, lore of the village and abbey, and warning them about the Abbot. 
* The party visited the Shrine of the White Sun in the north of the village where they discovered a shrine to the Morninglord and discovered the restorative properties of the pools waters. 
* The party then went to investigate the Abbey of St. Markovia. Upon entering the gates two mongrelfolk guards (sleeping when they arrived) asked their business before escorting them further into the grounds to the entrance of the Abbey.

* Fel meets up with Igor and Ireena as they are brought to the flesh golem. The Abbot told the golem to lead the party to Ezmerelda's room on the upper level of the east wing. 
* The party sans Thonk met with Ezmerelda. The party was uncharacteristically open with her abou their history and goals, which was met with an equal return in clarity by Ezmerelda. 
* Ezmerelda told the party she was looking for the Baron's son Ilya who she suspects to be with the nearby werewolf den, and she was investigating the Abbot about his past and possible future healing. 
* Ezmerelda invited the party to perform a seance with her to ask a spirit of the Abbey (St. Markovia, party does not know) about the Abbot, and any remaining questions (10 total) the party could use for their own benefit. 
* Ezmerelda agreed to aid the party in their fight against Strahd on the following conditions, which were agreed too...

* The Krezkovs took the party outside and into the Wine Cellar, and then the Hidden Basement, where the two spilled the beans about Ilya's transformation and their deal with the Abbot. When the party mentioned they were already working with Ezmerelda the Krezkovs were immediately taken aback and thankful. 
* The party took a long rest without interruption. Thonk dreamed of weighted scales, cracked armour, and holy men living and expiring. 
* The party met with Ezmerelda in the morning and learned her plan for the day, namely, 
	* head to her wagon near Lake Baratok to gather supplies,
	* set up camp and wait for the nightfall for the werewolf pack to exit the den,

	* It is a mystery why the potion Anna prepared for Ilya did not prevent his hybrid transformation during the full moon. 
* The next morning the party met with Ezmerelda to gather supplies from her wagon at Lake Baratok. 
* MOVE ON BELOW. 
## Recap of last session
* Party followed Ezmerelda to a hollow in the Svalich Wood that overlooks the entrance to the Werewolf Den. Ezmerelda lit a fire using her Furtive Firestarter. 
* Ezmerelda invited the party to tell campfire tales about their lives and shared two of her own, one about van Richten, and another about the Black Terror. 
* An hour after nightfall a number of werewolves, one much larger than the rest, exited the den before moving west into the Svalich Wood likely toward the mists, as Ezmerelda predicted. 
* The party moved toward the entrance to the Werewolf Den where they were met by the corpse of an enormous beast. 
* The party found two guards near the mouth of the cave that is the Werewolf Den. Using Pass without Trace and subterfuge they managed to lure the guards outside.

	* Godfrey asks the players to explore the mansion of Argynvostholt on his behalf, investigating the spirits that lurk within to uncover their knowledge of Argynvost’s whispers.
	* Sir Godfrey further warns the players that not all of the mansion's restless spirits are friendly. Godfrey notes that these warlike spirits cannot be dissuaded from their mad crusade, and that few weapons or spells can harm their incorporeal forms. "Of all the creatures in this manor," he notes, "only the arachnids that haunt the Ethereal realm give them pause."

The angel bestows a small silver statuette upon the woman. The man at further investigation seems to have envy in eyes.

* Party had Zorya breathe spectral fire into the beacon and received their task to return Argynvosts skull from Castle Ravenloft to his tomb. 
* Party spoke with Sir Godfrey before leaving Argynvostholt. Godfrey promised they would speak more of the Amber Temple if they completed their task from Argynvosts' spirit.  
* Party travelled from Argynvostholt to Vallaki without issue. 
* While in Vallaki...
	* Party checked in on Father Lucian, Yeska and Milivoj at St. Andral's. Thonk stayed behind to help with some chores. 
	* Fel got a longbow silvered. On his way back he received a note from Arrigal (in disguise) alerting them to the presence of a spy within Castle Ravenloft who seeks to meet with the party. 
	* Igor requisitioned some leather armor from Lady Wachter, and subtly intimidated a local bureaucrat named Igor to get his paperwork for a Vallakian church to mother night moving forward. 
	* Party took a long rest and took a day of downtime to late-afternoon on 14 Neyavr. During this time they made a plan to rent a carriage and have Ezmerelda coach them to Castle Ravenloft, and leaving her to investigate around the exterior of Ravenloft. They also had an agent of the Keepers of the Feather perform reconnaissance of the castle the day leading to their arrival. 
* Party left Vallaki for Castle Ravenloft at 1pm on 14 Neyavr. 
* Party was stopped by a Skeletal Rider, whose armor looks similar to that of a dead rider they found in the woods when they first arrived in Barovia, just before crossing the Western Gate of Barovia. 
	* The Skeletal Rider led them to an old oak tree in the nearby Svalich Wood. 
	* In the tree they found a letter from a "Katarina" to a "Varushka", the former telling their apparent partner they have been offered a "new future" and must abandon her, if she still lives, after a "slaughter", and detailing the location of a gift left for them higher in the tree. 
	* Fel spoke with a pair of ravens guarding a metallic object in their nest, who said their task is to defend the treasure, and was given by "She Who Seeks in Storm-Clouds". 
	* Fel managed to grab the trinket, a locket-half made of tarnished silver. 
	* On their way back, the agent told them that not much activity happened outside Ravenloft, and a black carriage had left coming this direction more than an hour ago. 
* Party continued moving toward Castle Ravenloft, and were met by Strahds Black Carriage at a fork in the Old Svalich Road just past the Western Gate of Barovia. They had Ezmerelda park the carriage in the nearby woods, but continue with her reconnaissance. The party sans Ezmerelda then entered the carriage. 
* The carriage contained a note and gift from Strahd. The gift was a box locked with a puzzle the party solved. The box itself was a Box of Holding, and contained a fine pair of gloves and fur cape for each of the players. While the party solved the puzzle the carriage took them to Castle Ravenloft. 
* Paused when the players arrived at Castle Ravenloft. 

# 2 NOV 2025
Resuming 14 Neyavr, dusk

* The party arrived at Castle Ravenloft and were met by Rahadin and Anastrasya. 
	* Anastrasya noticed Igor wearing the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind and claimed that it "somewhat resembled an item an *old friend* of hers once wore, long ago". 
* The party were led inside by Rahadin, Anastrasya, Escher, and Sasha (Strahds eldest bride). Inside they found Volenta and Ludmilla. Anastrasya made introductions and back-handed compliments to the other wives. You noticed Sasha was taken aback at the sight of Ireena, and so distraught at Anastrasya's words, she dug her claws into her palms deep enough to draw blood. 
* In the Guest Hall a servant man named Anton wearing a white mask over his face offered wine, and "wine" to the group. He did not speak a single word, and you noticed all his fingers had been severed to the first knuckle, his hands were trembling, and a deep fear in his eyes. He stumbled while pouring Volenta's wine and she was ready to mortally punish Anton for this accident. Igor attempted to intervene, but Rahadin made it understood that while the party had guestright, they did not have a license to interfere in the affairs of the castle. After easing the tension with words, Strahd entered applauding the show, before inviting the party to the Dining Hall. 
* Fel accompanied Sasha to a lower level of the castle to grab a mop to clean the aforementioned spill where he found Cyrus Belview, cooking in the kitchen. Fel then accompanied Sasha to the Wine Cellar where the body of a blood drained woman was held up by her feet. Sasha made her distaste for the other vampires, and perhaps herself, clear. On the way back Sasha told Fel a little about her past, mainly her imprisonment for nearly four centuries, before asking if he and the party had any other goals in coming to Castle Ravenloft than to attend their dinner with Strahd. Fel kept the parties plans hidden, and was escorted back to the Dining Hall before Sasha departed. 
* During your dinner, Strahd made polite conversation inviting you all to share your lands of origin, experiences with magic and faith, the histories of your families and people, and the origins and extent of your expertise. Strahd seemed to enjoy the theological debates and discussions of martial training and strategy. 
* When the conversation began winding down, Strahd asked the party to engage in a series of questions to "explore your wit and cunning", stating "As lord of this land, it intrigues me to learn how others might evaluate the dilemmas that power so of present". The party agreed and responded to his hypothetical questions of rulership in the events of monetary troubles, war and diplomacy, and existential threats. After those questions Strahd openly asked if you all had any idea of the location of Rudolph van Richten. You all collectively feigned ignorance, but it seems Strahd could see through your deception, though he did not address it. Finally Strahd offered you all a short tour of Castle Ravenloft, which you accepted. 
* Strahd led you from the Dining Hall to the Chapel, then upstairs, where in a long hallway he paused and asked if you recognized the figure depicted on a mural on the wall. No one knew, and Strahd informed you it was of his father, King Barov, leading his fearsome knights into glorious battle, wielding his sword the Brightblade (broken long ago according to him). 
* Paused afterwards. 

# 9 NOV 2025
Resuming 14 Neyavr, night

* The party entered the Audience Hall as part of Strahds tour of Castle Ravenloft. The party noticed the throne had been turned to face away from the interior of the hall, and Strahd spoke of how it would be "an arrogance beyond folly" to name himself king without a kingdom to rule. From his words it seems as though he does not plan on his lands being lost from his forever. 
* Rahadin entered the chamber and delivered a prisoner, a vallakian who murdered his neighbor, and whose body has been warped beyond recognition. Strahd, impressed with your prowess, gave the party the opportunity to carry out his punishment, death. At first no one was willing, but after hearing Ludmilla would be his tormentor, Igor shot an arrow in his back to Strahds amusement. 
* Shortly afterwards a stray bolt of lightning struck in the castle courtyard, damaging the magical mechanism by which the drawbridge moves and allows access to and from the castle. Strahd led you to the ground floor to await news as Ludmillas servant Diavola inspected the damage. 
* Diavola informed Strahd the drawbridge required repairs that would not be complete until morning. Strahd offered the party use of the Guest Suite as it would be impossible to leave Castle Ravenloft tonight. The party accepted and were led to the Guest Suite by Sasha. 
* The party was able to get Sasha to open up as they entered the Guest Suite. In return for a promise the players would rescue Gertruda they learned the following information...
	* Ever since his awakening, Strahd has departed the castle once each fortnight atop his **nightmare** steed Beucephalus on the night of the new moon. 
	* Gertruda is a prisoner on the third floor of the castle, in the king’s suites. The players can access the suites via the staircase in the foyer (<span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair, p. 59</span>).
	*  Sasha doesn’t know any of the traps that Strahd or his servants might have set in the castle. She does know, however, that the inside of the keep is often patrolled by undead **wights**. 
	* Strahd keeps prisoners in the dungeons, on the floor beneath the castle larders. The players can access the dungeons via the staircase in the foyer (<span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair, p. 59</span>).
	* Sasha has seen a dragon’s skull once—in a basement chamber that Volenta has more recently transformed into an ossuary. The chamber (<span class="citation">K67. Hall of Bones (p. 78)</span>) is behind the closed wooden doors to the west of <span class="citation">K65. Kitchen (p. 78)</span>.
	* Although she hasn’t descended there since Strahd freed her from her crypt, the castle catacombs are accessible via <span class="citation">K18. High Tower Staircase (p. 58)</span>.
	* Strahd has commanded his spawn to report the presence of any intruders into the castle, and Sasha therefore can’t help the players enter the keep herself. However, she can share the existence of a second, rear servants’ entrance (<span class="citation">K23. Servants’ Entrance (p. 59))</span> into the castle via <span class="citation">K3. Servants’ Courtyard (p. 54)</span>, which allows access to the servants’ quarters and kitchens.
	* Should the players require it while navigating the castle, Sasha recalls that Strahd's oldest password is "I come in Dostron's memory." She isn't sure who Dostron is, or whether Strahd still uses it as a password, but believes him arrogant enough to believe that none in the castle—other than Rahadin—is old enough to remember it. 
	* Sasha warns the players that they likely won't be able to depart the castle without facing Rahadin, the castle chamberlain.
* As the players conversation with Sasha came to a close, a knock came to the door. Rahadin and Escher dismissed Sasha and warned the players to not leave their chambers until morning. Rahadin tasked Escher with standing guard outside the door, and Rahadin himself locked the door to the Guest Suites. Rahadin promised to unlock the door at the first light of morning. 
* The party investigated the Guest Suite, but found little of note other than a trapdoor leading up and and out to another floor in the bedroom closet. To activating mechanism is the rightmost hook in the closet. 
* The party began taking a long rest. After some amount of time the party found themselves awoken in the Guest Suite, now suffused with a gray misty light, and a sonorous echo from the clock. Not long thereafter the party heard a thump from the closet door, the clock struck ten, and they all felt a sharp pressure in their necks. It was then they made a CON saving throw, and took 7 (or 3) damage and had their HP maximum lowered by that amount. 
* Igor took to destroying the clock, but found it unharmed just as soon as he looked away from it for a moment. Investigating the closet the party found a womans corpse. Ascending through the trapdoor in the closet the party found themselves exiting through a trapdoor in the landing to the Guest Suites. 
* Here the party found the stairwells covered by stone, and a figure emerging from it. The figure introduced himself as Ismark Antonivich, whom you all know as Ismark the Great, an ancestor of the Ismark you left in the Village of Barovia. Ismark told the party he and his companion Lugdana came to Castle Ravenloft in search of the Sigil of the Sun. Igor showed him the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, Ismark recognized it as matching the description of the object he is searching for, and told him to keep it close as they make their escape from the castle. 
* The party and Ismark made their way inside the Guest Suite. When they attempted to open the closet door the furniture in the Guest Suite animated and attacked. 
* Paused immediately after combat. 

# 16 NOV 2025
Resuming 14 Neyavr, night

* Resuming immediately after combat on floor 2 of Varushka's Nightmare (VN). 
* The party made to ascend through the trapdoor in the Guest Room Closet. Ismark bid them farwell and good luck, noting he would seek Lugdana elsewhere.
* The party discovered Pidlwick II under the bed in the Guest Room on floor 3 of VN. The hook which controls the opening mechanism of the trapdoor was missing. The party asked Pidlwick for help, but after he was unable to assist well, Igor threatened him. Pidlwick led Igor to the stairwell and pushed him down before vanishing. The party found the hook hidden inside the clock in the Guest Room and ascended to the next floor. 
* The party found the closet walled off in the Guest Room. Fel broke the windows in the Lounge and saw the closet across the rooftop. Using their abilities to fly, Fel and Igor made it to the far end of the rooftop without issue before a rumbling was heard from inside the castle nearby. 
* A large black dragon with similar features to that of Rahadin made the remainder of the parties escape difficult, but everyone was ultimately able to cross the rooftop before more of the acid-turned-chains from the dragon immobilized some completely. 
* After climbing ascending the trapdoor ladder in the closet on the rooftop, everyone again found themselves in the Guest Suite landing. Moving into the Lounge you all heard sobbing coming from the Guest Room where you were met a woman on the bed by the name of Varushka, clutching a locket from her dear friend Katarina, and blood running down her neck from a familiar puncture wound... 
* Varushka told you ten days prior she had seen King von Zarovich speak with "a great darkness" in his chambers, and later the skies grew red, the mists descended on the valley, and Zarovich had "become a monster". She also mentioned Rahadin keeps the key to the Guest Suite in his office in the cellars. 
* Moving from the bedroom to the closet near Varushka led you to a room in a lower level of the castle, the sky outside delivering blood-red light through the windows and a screams heard from a staircase descending deeper into the castle. Here you found Varushka again, hiding under a table, and imploring you to hide or flee as Strahd searches for Captain Dilisnya, whom she saw abscond by means she cant explain. 
* Moving down toward the source of the noise you found yourselves in the castle larders, the door at the far end of the hall ajar. Entering the hall you heard a familiar voice cursing Dilisnya from beyond another door to the north. 
* Moving past the door in the north end of the hall you saw Strahd ending the life of one of his former men-at-arms. You attempted to converse with the blood-raged Strahd for a short time, but combat was nigh-inevitable. 
* You defeated this apparent younger version of Strahd before he turned to mist and escaped through a crack in the wall.
