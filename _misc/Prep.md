## 4 JAN 2025
* Starting 3 Neyavr, midday
* Resuming after Volenta fled after battle with the party. 
* Party still needs to recover bones. [[CoS Reloaded/Curse of Strahd Reloaded/Act II - The Shadowed Town/Arc D - St. Andral's Feast#D4b. Recovering the Bones]]
* Party may investigate Rictavios' cart after retreiving the bones. [[CoS Reloaded/Curse of Strahd Reloaded/Act II - The Shadowed Town/Arc D - St. Andral's Feast#D3. Arasek Stockyard]]
	* Erasmus will attempt to scare the players away from the cart. 
	* The carts padlock is trapped with a poison needle. 
	* If the party manages to open the cart, they find Arabelle as described [[CoS Reloaded/Curse of Strahd Reloaded/Act II - The Shadowed Town/Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E8c. Rictavio’s Wagon]]. 
* Party still needs to return the bones to Father Lucian by dawn on 7 Neyavr. [[CoS Reloaded/Curse of Strahd Reloaded/Act II - The Shadowed Town/Arc D - St. Andral's Feast#D5. Retrieving the Bones]]
* Assuming the party returns the bones on 3 Neyavr, Rahadin will deliver his proclamation on 4 Neyavr - always at dusk the following day [[CoS Reloaded/Curse of Strahd Reloaded/Act II - The Shadowed Town/Arc D - St. Andral's Feast#D6. Rahadin's Visit]]
* Thonk must have a nightmare about his lycanthropy during his next Long Rest [[CoS Reloaded/Curse of Strahd Reloaded/Act I - Into the Mists/Arc C - Into the Valley#C11. The Werewolves' Hunt]]. Anyone can inform him the next full moon is on 8 Neyavr. Father Lucian cannot cast *Remove Curse*. 

## 12 JAN 2025
* Starting 3 Neyavr, early evening
* Resuming after the party returns to Vallaki after agreeing to find Arabelle for Luvash and Arrigal. 
* The party will likely begin [[Arc G - Lady Wachter’s Wish]] by visiting Wachterhaus directly upon their return. Otherwise they will receive the invitation on their next visit to the inn, likely the same night.

* Thonk must have a nightmare about his lycanthropy during his next Long Rest [[CoS Reloaded/Curse of Strahd Reloaded/Act I - Into the Mists/Arc C - Into the Valley#C11. The Werewolves' Hunt]]. Anyone can inform him the next full moon is on 8 Neyavr. Father Lucian cannot cast *Remove Curse*. 
* Rahadin will deliver his proclamation at dusk on 4 Neyavr.

# 26 JAN 2025
* Starting 4 Neyavr, after-dinner
* Resuming after the party agrees to Lady Wachter's conspiracy. 
* During their dinner with Lady Wachter, Izek will have visited the Blue Water Inn to find Ireena, damaging the Inn. As Ireena was not present at this Inn at this time, Izek did not find the Martikovs' locked chest.

* Players are working concurrently on [[CoS Reloaded/Curse of Strahd Reloaded/Act II - The Shadowed Town/Arc E - The Missing Vistana]] and [[CoS Reloaded/Curse of Strahd Reloaded/Act II - The Shadowed Town/Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish]], so they will likely deal with Izek or travel to Khazan's tower.

* Arc D: Rahadin will visit Vallaki at dusk on the first night after the bones have been restored (DONE), and Lady Wachter has assumed power (Arc F, ongoing) or after rescuing Ireena after being kidnapped by Izek Strazni (Arc G, ongoing). 
* Arc E: The party is making their way to Vallaki after dealing with the werewolves on the road back.

* Arc E: Luvash will tell the party that he will feed false info to Strahd once at the their request - but not more. The info cannot be obviously false, and provides no guarantee if or how long Strahd will believe the information. Otherwise, DONE. 
* Arc F: The party obtained the poisoned wine from Ernst the morning of 5 Neyavr (yesterday) after agreeing to Lady Wachters plan. 
* Arc G: META: I messed up, Yan's severed head should have been in Van Richten's cart, so the party could interrogate it, and then would have brokered the deal between Richten and Arrigal immediately on 5 Neyavr. Since they had to wait until the next morning, they had no chance to eliminate Izek before he kidnaps Ireena the morning of 6 Neyavr. To make it fair without going back in time - Izek will capture Ireena during the night of 6 Neyavr. As the party was brokering a deal in the woods near the Vistani Camp south of Vallaki, a Vallakian delivers a tip to the Burgormasters mansion regarding Ireena's current location. Izek alongside four guards kidnap her during the morning sermons before the party returns to Vallaki. Ireena is currently bound and gagged in Izek's bedroom in the burgormasters mansion. Izek will not leave this room for any substantial period of time until the Festival of the Blazing Sun.  
* Arc H: Tonight (6 Neyavr) the spirit of Erasmus will appear as a poltergeist and invite them to meet with Victor. 
* Arc I: The players may attempt to visit Krezk for a variety of reasons. If so they will begin this arc.

	* Party will tell Marek why they came
	* Marek will be reluctant to share info regarding Agrynvosts spirit: "the old dragon has earned his rest, further contact with the living will only torment his ghost."
	* If/when pushed Marek will reply, bitterly and intensely: “I have stood knee deep in mud and bone, and filled my lungs with pyres’ ash. I have seen knights of valor fall, oaths shattered with their bodies and blades. I have dug trenches for the refugees; I have prayed for their deliverance, and waited for salvation that never came. Hope? Hope is but a lie on the wind—a worm that devours the hearts of men. There is no escape from this Hell while Strahd von Zarovich yet lives."
	* If the players insist that they intend to destroy Strahd von Zarovich, Brother Marek barks a bitter laugh and responds, ultimately needing the party to convince him. 
		* If successful he tells them to "seek the younger of the twin dragons above". 
		* if unsuccessful he tells them to provide proof of Argynvosts favor from his tomb. "Lord Argynvost's tomb lies empty in the graveyard below. Speak your intentions with honest and courage. Should he hear your words, he may grant you a token of his favor. Bring me proof of that favor, and I shall give you the guidance you seek"
	* After being convinced Marek will wish the party good luck and bid them farewell. 
* Party will move upwards from the second floor to the rooftop of the manor. 
	* When opening a door to the rooftop from either stairwell (Q31), the party will immediately be attacked by the Phantom Warriors in the roof turrets (Q52) behind them. 
	* The party will combat the Phantom Warriors. 
	* The party will investigate the rooftop. 
	* The party will climb the Beacon Tower and meet Vladimir Horngaard.
		* Vladimir will give his warning and await the parties response. 
		* Party will start combat with Horngaard

Reminders
* Trapdoor in K51 Closet leads upwards to another floor 20 ft. above. Getting close you hear the maniacal cackling of women and the bubbling of something boiling. Opening the trapdoor the sound of the storm grows louder and fresh air faintly permeates through, it seems the floor above opens to fresh air, though perhaps not immediately. 

Session
* Party is about to leave the second level of Varushka's Nightmare after defeating the animated furniture. Ismark will bid the party farewell before they continue to the next floor. 
* Third Floor
	* Area is largely as described earlier, though less run down. The lounge door lacks the ornate gold lock found earlier. 
	* Anyone entering the Guest Room will hear a new ticking noise from under the bed. Looking or disturbing it they will find Pidlwick II. In the closet the activating mechanism for the trapdoor is missing. Pidlwick II will use simple gestures to communicate it has hidden the hook somewhere in the Guest Suite. 
		* DC 12 Persuasion to convince to show them the clock. 
		* DC 10 Intimidation to have Pidlwick bring them to landing. DC 10 DEX or 100ft fall down K48 stairs. Pidlwick disappears immediately. 
* Fourth Floor
	* Area is largely as described earlier, somewhat run-down, but free of much of the grime and age. The lounge door lacks the ornate gold lock. 
	* The closet opens to a blank stone wall, when the party sees this, the windows in the Lounge slam open. Looking outside, read from the description. 
* Fifth Floor
	* This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">K49. Lounge (p. 70)</span> and <span class="citation">K50. Guest Room (p. 70)</span>. However, the castle’s stone is bright, clean, and freshly carved, with its furniture pristine and newly crafted. In addition, the door leading to <span class="citation">K49. Lounge (p. 70)</span> lacks the ornate gold lock from [[#O8a. The First Level]].
