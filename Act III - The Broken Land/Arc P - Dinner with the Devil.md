At dusk on the night immediately after the full moon, Strahd—using information gleaned from his spies and a location assessed from his *scrying* spell—sends Rahadin, his chamberlain, to deliver them a letter.

> [!info]+ **When Does the Invitation Arrive?**  
> Strahd sends the invitation on the night immediately after the full moon or as described in [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Act II - The Shadowed Town/Arc E - St. Andral's Feast#E7a. The Invitation|Arc E - St. Andral's Feast]], whichever happens first.

Rahadin, riding his _phantom steed_—an ash—gray horse with dull, shadowed eyes—makes the journey to Vallaki in a little over an hour. Whether Lady Wachter or the Baron rules in Vallaki, the guards at the gates are too terrified to bar entry to Strahd's chamberlain and herald. 

Rahadin then makes his way to the players' current location before dismounting from his horse and entering. If the players are in the Blue Water Inn, the entire taproom falls silent upon his entrance.

When the players first see Rahadin, read:

<div class="description">
<p>You see a tall, lithe man of dusky complexion, with long, black hair that falls past his shoulders. A light cloak is draped across his shoulders, its edge rimmed with thick, white fur, and gloves of supple black leather cover his hands. A deep blue tunic trimmed with bronze is visible beneath a layer of tough, yet flexible leather armor, and a curved saber hangs from a sheath at his belt, with a pair of scimitars strapped to his back above it.</p>
<p>His ears taper sharply upward to elven points, and his dark, brown eyes bear a quiet awareness and a casual, almost predatory gaze as they shift slowly across his surroundings. A long, wicked scar cuts across his forehead, just above where lines have begun to mark his face with age, and his lips are pulled back into a thin, perpetual frown.</p>
</div>

As Rahadin approaches the players (or vice—versa), the players can hear the sounds of his ***deathly choir.*** Read:

<div class="description">
<p>It begins with a dull roar—a prickle at the edge of your awareness, like the washing of the ocean against the shore. As the man grows closer, however, the muffled sound grows ever—more insistent, amplifying and building upon itself—until it resolves from a more innocuous sound, almost like waves, into a torrent of screams.</p>
<p>Your ears fill with a cacophony of a thousand voices, pleading, suffering, dying: a psychic onslaught that crashes against your mind from every direction, leaving little room for thought. The man, however, remains unflinching—seemingly undisturbed by the symphony of screams that surrounds him.</p>
</div>

The players can notice that any other Barovians within ten feet of Rahadin appear to be similarly disturbed. (Any Barovians beyond the ten—foot radius can't hear the screams.) When Rahadin speaks, the screams somewhat recede—enough to allow him and others to be heard—but gain a notable accent of fear.

Rahadin greets the players and informs them that he has come to deliver them an invitation from his "master." He then retrieves an envelope sealed with crimson wax and bearing the Von Zarovich crest: a raven with its wings spread across a tall shield wrapped with a banner and bearing the image of a castle at its peak.

If opened, the envelope reads as follows, beginning with a list of the players' names and filling in the blank with the number of days until the next new moon. (Due to Barovia's shortened lunar calendar, the next new moon takes place seven days after the players' first full moon in Barovia.)

<div class="description">
<p>To [Player Names],</p> 
<p>I have heard tell of your recent exploits in my domain, and wish to better know those who have arrived in my beloved land of Barovia. As such, I bid you dine at my castle so that we may meet in civilized surroundings.</p>
<p>I expect your attendance at dusk on the night of the new moon, in ___ days' time. Your passage here will be a safe one, and you shall be honored guests for as long as you remain at Castle Ravenloft.</p>
<p>I await your arrival.</p>
<p>Your host,<br>
Strahd von Zarovich</p>
</div>

Rahadin declines to depart until the players have read Strahd's invitation and confirmed their attendance. If the players accept Strahd's invitation, Rahadin inclines his head and notes that he will expect them at Castle Ravenloft promptly at dusk on the noted date.

If the players ask or appear to be concerned as to whether Strahd truly means not to harm them, Rahadin coldly notes that Strahd is lord of the land, and his word of safe passage to and from the dinner is binding on both others and himself. "He has promised you guestright," Rahadin notes, glaring. "Do not presume to spit upon his honor or authority."

If the players ask or appear to be concerned whether Ireena would be safe at the castle, Rahadin coldly notes that both the players and any of their companions would be welcome guests and protected under guestright, so long as they have not committed any offense against Strahd personally—which, to Rahadin's knowledge, neither Ireena nor the players have done. If the players appear doubtful, Rahadin notes coolly, "Had my master sought to take Lady Kolyana from you, he could have done so as it pleased him, without your permission. She is, of course, not obliged to attend—but I advise you not to question the strength of his word."

If the players ask to delay their response, Rahadin coolly notes that his "master" expects an answer upon his return. 

If the players refuse Strahd's invitation or continue to insist upon delaying their response, Rahadin quietly, without touching his scimitars or raising his voice above a whisper, asks them if they think it wise to insult the lord of Castle Ravenloft. "It is no threat, I assure you," he promises if challenged. "Consider it … cordial advice."

If the players again refuse the invitation or continue to stall, Rahadin shakes his head in disappointment. He notes that he had warned "his master" of his suspicion that the players would be "difficult, impolite, and undesirable guests," and shares that he will take no pleasure in informing his master that he was correct. 

If the players make no move to stop him, Rahadin then moves toward the door, pauses, and quietly notes that, despite his own misgivings, he would not be surprised if his master holds open the invitation regardless, should the players change their minds. He then departs.
