In this act, which begins the morning after the players' first full moon in Vallaki, the players receive a pair of invitations.

The first, a plea from Urwin Martikov, asks the players to travel to the Wizard of Wines winery to the west in order to investigate a mysterious wine shortage in [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act III - The Broken Land/Arc K - The Stolen Gem]].

The second, a letter from Strahd von Zarovich himself, invites the players to dine at Castle Ravenloft with him and his court on the night of the new moon in six days' time in [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act III - The Broken Land/Arc P - Dinner with the Devil]].

Should the players accept the Martikovs' mission in [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act III - The Broken Land/Arc K - The Stolen Gem]], they gain two companions for the journey: Muriel Vinshaw, a **wereraven** agent of the Keepers of the Feather; and Ireena Kolyana, who asks to join the players permanently in the fight against Strahd. The players must rescue the winery from the Forest Folk **druids** who have conquered it and, once they have done so, retrieve an enchanted gem from Yester Hill to the south before the Wizard of Wines falls to destruction.

Meanwhile, as the players explore other leads across the western half of the Barovia, they can recruit the Vistana monster hunter Ezmerelda d'Avenir in [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act III - The Broken Land/Arc L - The Fallen Abbey]], investigate the werewolf pack in [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act III - The Broken Land/Arc M - The Den of Wolves]], and uncover the mysteries of Argynvostholt in [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act III - The Broken Land/Arc N - Argynvost's Beacon]].

In the process, they'll obtain multiple reasons to journey to Castle Ravenloft: to recover the *Icon of Ravenloft* to cleanse the Abbot's corruption in [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act III - The Broken Land/Arc L - The Fallen Abbey]]; to rescue the **werewolf** Emil Toranescu in exchange for the *Holy Symbol of Ravenloft* in [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act III - The Broken Land/Arc M - The Den of Wolves]]; and to steal the skull of the dragon Argynvost to bring hope to the land once more in [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act III - The Broken Land/Arc N - Argynvost's Beacon]].

As the night of the dinner at Ravenloft approaches, Lady Fiona Wachter will also ask the players to investigate a series of grisly murders in [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act III - The Broken Land/Arc O - The Moonlit Murders]]. As they close in on the killer, the players will need to clear Rudolph van Richten's name—and lift his curse—in order to bring peace once more to Vallaki.

On the night of the new moon, the players can dine with Strahd von Zarovich and the members of his court in [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act III - The Broken Land/Arc P - Dinner with the Devil]]. There, they'll learn that Strahd will be gone from the castle the following night, creating the perfect opportunity to infiltrate the castle in [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act III - The Broken Land/Arc Q - Ravenloft Heist]]. Once they have done so, the players must then return to the western valley to purify the Abbot's soul, defeat the **werewolf** Kiril Stoyanovich, and relight the beacon of Argynvostholt.

This act ends at dusk on the first night after the players infiltrate Castle Ravenloft in [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act III - The Broken Land/Arc Q - Ravenloft Heist]]. However, the players can still complete unresolved arcs from this act even after Act IV begins—assuming, of course, that those arcs are still possible to complete.
