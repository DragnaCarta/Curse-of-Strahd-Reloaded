_An adventure for five 4th, 5th, or 6th-level characters._

In this arc, upon arriving at the mansion of Argynvostholt as suggested by the revenants at Tser Falls or the Raven River Crossroads, the players encounter Sir Godfrey Gwilym, an ancient **revenant** knight of the Order of the Silver Dragon.

Godfrey solemnly informs the players that, because he is bound to the will of his commander, Vladimir Horngaard, he can offer them no aid in their fight against Strahd. He can share, however, that the slumbering spirit of the silver dragon Argynvost—the deceased leader of their Order—has stirred in recent weeks, and that the dragon is seeking heroes willing to stand against Strahd, though Godfrey doesn't know for what purpose.

Though Godfrey cannot hear the voice of Argynvost himself, he encourages the players to explore the mansion and seek out the clues left by the dragon’s spirit by speaking with the other ghosts of the mansion—though he warns them to avoid the audience hall of Commander Horngaard himself. 

Godfrey also warns the players to be wary of the cursed spirits that still haunt the mansion’s halls: soldiers who fell defending the mansion from Strahd’s armies long ago, and who have never ceased their fight against invaders. Should the players wish to protect themselves from those spirits, Godfrey advises them to travel to a mass grave north of Berez, where the players can obtain paraphernalia bearing the insignia of the Order of the Silver Dragon.

As the players explore Argynvostholt, they can encounter Zorya, the spirit of Argynvost's late **pseudodragon** familiar; Minodora, the spirit of a former clerk of the Order of the Silver Dragon; and Brother Marek, the spirit of the Order's former chaplain. The spirits' guidance will bring the players to Argynvost's beacon, where Argynvost's spirit lurks within a silver dragon gargoyle.

To invoke Argynvost's spirit, however, the players must obtain and speak aloud the oath of the Order of the Silver Dragon and light the gargoyle's brazier with silver flames obtained from Zorya or Argynvost's tomb. However, Vladimir Horngaard himself stands watch over the mansion's high beacon. If the players wish to learn Argynvost's will, they must first reassure Horngaard that they pose no threat to him or Strahd—or else defeat Horngaard in battle.

From the gargoyle, the players can obtain a cryptic prophecy directing them to return Argynvost's bones to their rightful place in his crypt. To do so, however, they must first retrieve his remains from the depths of Castle Ravenloft.

If the players return to Argynvostholt after successfully retrieving Argynvost’s skull, they must fight their way past Vladimir and his **phantom warrior** bodyguards in order to return the dragon’s remains to their rightful place. Should they succeed, Argynvost’s spirit lights the beacon atop the darkened mansion, bringing light and hope to all corners of Barovia, and allowing the knights of the Order of the Silver Dragon to find rest and blessed peace.

> [!warning]+ **Impossible Encounters**
> Two combat encounters in this arc—the battle with the **phantom warriors** and the potential battle with **Vladimir Horngaard**—have been balanced for a party of five 6th-level players plus Ezmerelda and Ireena. Parties without Ezmerelda and/or below 6th level will likely be unable to overcome these encounters. Accordingly, all players have been given a noncombat route to bypassing the **phantom warriors**, a social route to bypassing Vladimir Horngaard, and a "failing forward" failsafe in the event of a TPK to Vladimir Horngaard.

# M1. Road to Argynvostholt
When the players arrive at the path from the Old Svalich Road to Argynvostholt, read:

<div class="description">
<p>A dirt path branches off from the Old Svalich Road here, winding its way south up a craggy mountain spur. The earth of the path is hard-packed, its color a pallid gray-brown reminiscent of cold ashes. The trees on either side stand silent and stoic, their leaves a faded green. As the path winds upward, it's eventually replaced by the deep shadows of the mountain's forested incline, vanishing into the gloom of the woods beyond.</p>
</div>

The journey from the Old Svalich Road to Argynvostholt is two miles long and takes forty minutes. Approximately halfway down the path, the players are met by a **revenant** knight of the Order of the Silver Dragon standing watch in the woods. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>Something stirs amidst the tree line, and a figure clad in rusted armor steps forth from the underbrush.</p>
</div>

The figure is recognizably similar to the **revenants** standing guard at Tser Falls and the Raven River Crossroads.

The revenant hails the players and asks them to identify themselves and their business. If informed that they have come seeking Sir Godfrey Gwilym, it closes its eyes and murmurs gratefully, “So there are still those who oppose Zarovich’s reign. Good." 

The revenant can inform the players that Sir Godfrey awaits visitors in the Chapel of Morning, at the eastern side of the first floor of the mansion of Argynvostholt. It warns them, however, that many unquiet spirits haunt the ruined manor, and to be wary should they explore its crumbling halls. 

Should the players request directions to the chapel, the revenant advises them to enter the foyer through the main entrance, then proceed eastward into the dining hall. There, the revenant tells them, “the doors to the chapel stand ever-open to those who seek a brighter dawn."

If the players ask the revenant to escort them to the mansion, it declines, noting gravely that it has been banished from its grounds and estate “for raising my voice against my commander, Vladimir Horngaard, when my oath could suppress my conscience no longer." It declines to explain further, advising the players to speak with Sir Godfrey instead.

Strands of black wire ensnare his chest in a macabre web, with additional strands looping down and around his biceps and rusted gauntlets before stretching across to the stone pillars on either side.</p>
<p>The knight's chain-mail shirt is dulled and corroded with age, his silver helm cracked and blackened. Beneath it, strands of silver-gray hair fall limply across his gaunt and ashen face.

<p>The knight’s head lifts, revealing red eyes that flash with a quiet intensity. His arms seem to flex, almost instinctively, against his black-wire bindings—and it’s then that you notice that each wire is covered with tiny, razor-sharp barbs, many of which bite deeply into his armor and flesh.</p>
<p>"Welcome, travelers," he rasps. “I must ask that you forgive my rudeness. I am ill-disposed to greet you properly."</p>

> [!info]+ **Godfrey’s Bindings**
> Because the revenants of the Order of the Silver Dragon were raised and bound by the hatred of Commander Vladimir Horngaard, they are magically bound in undeath by the oaths they made in life to obey and serve him. A revenant that contemplates violating one of Horngaard’s orders is ensnared by strands of black razor wire, which burrow into and restrain them to prevent such violation. (For example, a revenant that attempts to raise arms against Commander Horngaard may find their sword-arm bound, while a revenant that attempts to reveal Commander Horngaard’s secrets may find its jaw or tongue ensnared in razor wire.)
>
> The wire disappears when the revenant relinquishes its intentions to violate Horngaard’s command, leaving no wound or other trace. Until such a point, the wires have immunity to all damage and cannot be removed by any means.

> [!abstract]+ **The Lanterns**
> A player who inspects the lanterns realizes that the lights are not flames, but blurred and writhing spectral figures wearing armor and horned helmets. A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the words of their whispers, repeated in a maddened refrain: “Free us," “Forgive us," and “Where is the light?"
>
> If asked, Godfrey can inform the players that the spirits belong to soldiers of Strahd’s army—the same soldiers who slew Argynvost and died in Argynvostholt’s bloodstained halls on the final day of the war. Commander Horngaard, Godfrey shares, ordered that their spirits be imprisoned to suffer here for all eternity, without hope of rest or reincarnation. 
>
> Godfrey pities the spirits, having relinquished all hatred for them long ago. “Many were but children themselves," he murmurs, “fighting for mere coin to feed themselves or their families. They share not the blame for the hubris of their masters." Neither he nor the other knights of the Order can release the spirits against Horngaard’s orders, but he makes no protest if the players move to do so, and treats such a decision warmly.
>
> The players can release a spirit from its lantern by opening the lantern’s glass door. A spirit released from its lantern thanks the players for their mercy before dissipating into mist.

Godfrey introduces himself as Sir Godfrey Gwilym, knight of the Order of the Silver Dragon. If told the reason for the players’ arrival, he can confirm that the revenants at Tser Falls and the Raven River Crossroads invited the players to Argynvostholt on his orders, “for the hour is dire, and I have need of your aid."
### What Godfrey Knows
At the players’ request, Godfrey can share the following information regarding the Order of the Silver Dragon and his current predicament.

* Long ago, before the Mists descended upon the valley, the Order of the Silver Dragon was an order of knights dedicated to justice and the protection of the weak. The order was founded by Lord Argynvost—a man of great wealth, kindness, and valor. Only Godfrey and the remainder of Argynvost’s most trusted knights knew Argynvost’s deepest secret: that he was, in truth, a **silver dragon** in disguise.
* Not ten years after the Order first settled at Argynvostholt, Strahd von Zarovich brought war to the lands surrounding the valley. The Order ranged far afield to defend against Zarovich’s invading armies and shelter those made refugees by the violence, but ultimately found itself driven back to the valley and, ultimately, the mansion of Argynvostholt.

> [!abstract]+ **The Dragon's Scale**
> If a player in possession of the [[Character Creation#Inheritance—The Dragon's Scale|Dragon's Scale]] reveals it to Godfrey, the knight is briefly overcome with emotion and asks, hoarsely, to be allowed to see it more closely. He recognizes it aloud as one of Argynvost's own scales, and asks the player how they came upon it. If the player treats Argynvost's scale and legacy with reverence and respect, they have advantage on Charisma checks made toward Godfrey unless he becomes hostile to them.

Godfrey then asks the players whether they would seek to betray and abandon their comrades if forced to fight a hopeless battle, or if they would fight alongside them to the death. If he is satisfied that any of the players would choose loyalty over selfishness, he gently chides any who would do the opposite, then proceeds:

* A great battle took place on the floodplain east of the mansion, and many of the knights of the Order were slaughtered. As Godfrey and his commander, Vladimir Horngaard, led a final sortie against the enemy general’s camp, both were killed as well—Commander Horngaard by Zarovich himself, and Godfrey by Zarovich’s second-in-command: a cruel-eyed dusk elf bearing twin scimitars. (If asked, Godfrey can confirm that the elf was Rahadin, the current chamberlain of Castle Ravenloft.)
* Several years thereafter, Godfrey felt Commander Horngaard’s rage pull his soul from beyond the grave, and found himself and the other knights of the Order returned to life as undead revenants. He learned that Zarovich had desecrated Argynvost’s remains, burning the dragon's bones and taking his skull as a trophy to the new Castle Ravenloft—an act so foul it had stirred Horngaard to vengeful hatred even in death.
* The revenant knights renewed the fight against Strahd, waging war for months—until the Mists descended upon Barovia. The knights marched on Castle Ravenloft, where the Vistani crone Madam Eva met them at the castle gates. She told them Strahd had died and been reborn, and that he and all Barovia were now captives of the Mists.

Godfrey then asks the players if there is anyone that they hate—within or beyond the valley. He then asks if they would condemn all those they love to death and despair, if only to ensure that the one they hate would suffer the same fate for eternity. If he is satisfied that any of the players would choose love over vengeance, he informs them that they “stand amidst the ruin of one who made a different choice," then proceeds:

* Commander Horngaard and the knights returned to Argynvostholt. There, Commander Horngaard, his heart still clutched by hate, forbade the members of the Order from fighting Zarovich, who Commander Horngaard believed deserved to suffer in his prison for all eternity. Later, Commander Horngaard expanded his interdiction to Strahd’s servants and creatures as well, believing that Strahd’s dark dominion would only drive him to deeper levels of pain and misery—for what was a conqueror without anything left to conquer?
* The knights of the Order reluctantly obeyed Horngaard’s order, even as they watched the people of Barovia sink deeper into despair. As Strahd slumbered in his tomb, many among them came to believe that the Barovians’ nightmare may one day lift—until a knight came bearing news of a failed rebellion from the village of Barovia to the southeast, and Strahd’s threat to wipe the village and its people from the valley.
* A great quarrel erupted, as the knights demanded the right to defend the village from Strahd’s vengeance. Commander Horngaard, angered by their defiance, banished the other knights from the mansion. Only Godfrey, restrained by his bindings, did Horngaard allow to remain.

If asked about his bindings, Godfrey chuckles quietly, and explains that neither Commander Horngaard nor any of Strahd’s servants bound him here. “They are forged of my oath to Horngaard and the Order," he rumbles, “corrupted by the curse of undeath. They bind me against the defiance that burns in my heart." So long as he intends harm against Strahd, he tells them—a vow he will not and cannot forsake following Strahd’s crimes against the Barovians—they shall remain to restrain him.

If asked why he has summoned the players to Argynvostholt, Godfrey can share the following additional information:

* Argynvost may have fallen in the war against Strahd, but his spirit still lingers at Argynvostholt. In the decades after the Mists first descended, the dragon’s spirit appeared to Commander Horngaard in flickering visions, urging him away from his path of hatred and vengeance. However, Horngaard never turned from his path, and Argynvost’s spirit gradually fell quiet, sinking into a silent, dormant slumber.
* Shortly after Strahd awoke from his hibernation, Argynvost’s spirit began to stir again, though Godfrey doesn’t know why. The dragon’s spirit is too old and weak to manifest directly, but several of the other ghosts that haunt the mansion’s halls claim to have heard him whispering in his ethereal slumber, murmuring of a new generation of heroes, and a new and final front in the fight against darkness. 
* When the knights of the order were banished from Argynvostholt, Godfrey sent them to seek out those who Argynvost might be searching for, and direct them toward the manor.

“Perhaps you are the ones who he has been waiting for," Godfrey says. If any of the players are carrying an amber shard, he pauses, then fixes his gaze on that player. (If no player is carrying an amber shard, he instead looks toward whichever player most recently touched an amber shard, such as the one belonging to Elisabeth Durst or the one worn by Izek Strazni.) Godfrey then frowns and rasps, “Or perhaps not. I feel the chill of amber upon you. If you are pilgrims to the Amber Temple, then begone—I shall have no dealings with those who seek out its corruption."
### Godfrey & the Amber Shards
Godfrey is willing to continue dealing with the players if he is assured that they do not seek the dark gifts of the Amber Temple. The players can assure him as follows:

* A player without an amber shard can automatically convince Godfrey that they are free of any shard’s influence.
* A player in Stage One or Two of an amber shard’s corruption (see the [[Amber Shards]] appendix) can convince Godfrey that they do not intend to pursue the vestige’s gifts with a successful DC 14 Charisma (Deception) check if they are lying, and automatically if not. 
* A player in Stage Three of an amber shard’s corruption with visible signs of that corruption can convince Godfrey that they regret accepting the shard’s gift with a successful DC 14 Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check (depending on whether or not they’re telling the truth).

If Godfrey believes that any among the players are seeking the dark gifts of the Amber Temple or its amber shards, he demands those players explain their pursuit of corruption. “Its gifts are not gifts," he warns, “but chains that bind one's soul to the darkness. I have seen the strongest of wills crumble beneath its influence. The temple does not grant power, but consumes the soul that sought it out, leaving naught but a husk behind."

If a player possessing a shard fails to reassure Godfrey, he asks them gravely why they feel they *need* its power. "There is no shame in confessing fear or uncertainty," he says, his expression softening. "It is only when we allow those demons to cloud our judgment that we step wrongly."

If the player admits to desiring the shard's power for understandable—if not sympathetic—reasons, Godfrey assures them that they are no lesser for their struggles. "You are stronger than you know," he insists. "Embrace the power within you—not the lies and illusions these shards may promise. There is always a chance to turn away from the darkness, no matter how far we may feel we have fallen."

If a player possessing a shard stands steadfast by their decision to seek out its power or otherwise fails to reassure Godfrey, he demands that the players promise to cast the shard away—whether into Lake Zarovich, Lake Baratok, or elsewhere—upon departing Argynvostholt. Godfrey refuses to speak with the players further unless they make a promise to do so. (If the players are lying, they must also succeed on a group DC 14 Charisma (Deception) check to convince him.)

If asked about the Amber Temple, Godfrey is willing to share that the Amber Temple is a place of corruption and evil—and that the Order of the Silver Dragon’s first and secret purpose was to defend the Amber Temple from those who would seek out its power.

Godfrey is willing to share no more information than that. However, should the players express an interest in visiting the Amber Temple—such as to obtain the *Sunsword* or decode the mysteries of the *Tome of Strahd*—he laughs quietly and promises that he shall tell them of the Amber Temple if they first prove their character and will by uncovering and carrying out Argynvost’s final mission.
### Godfrey’s Request
Due to his restraints, Godfrey asks the players to explore the mansion of Argynvostholt on his behalf, investigating the spirits that lurk within to uncover their knowledge of Argynvost’s whispers.

If the players accept his request, Godfrey warns them to be wary of Commander Vladimir Horngaard, who yet stands vigil among the upper halls of the manor. “You must not allow him to see or hear you, or incite his anger should he do so," he insists. “He does not take kindly to outsiders, and far less so to those he believes seek Zarovich’s destruction. In life, he was the best of us; in death, his strength has only waxed—and now, he cannot be killed by sword, claw, or spell. His undeath is eternal; even if Zarovich himself slew him, Horngaard would soon return to pursue his prey again—a dogged and inevitable hunter." 

Godfrey warns the players to avoid mentioning his name should they meet with Commander Horngaard. "He does not look fondly upon me now, I fear," he mourns. "Should he believe I hold your sympathies, his suspicions shall only grow."

Sir Godfrey further warns the players that not all of the mansion's restless spirits are friendly. "Some among us never left the moments of our deaths," he warns. "Damned to relive the final days of the war, they attack all outsiders on sight, determined to defend these halls for eternity." 

Godfrey notes that these warlike spirits cannot be dissuaded from their mad crusade, and that few weapons or spells can harm their incorporeal forms. "Of all the creatures in this manor," he notes, "only the arachnids that haunt the Ethereal realm give them pause." (Godfrey is referring to the mated pair of **phase spiders** residing in [[#M4c. Spiders’ Ballroom]].) He adds that, even if the players were capable of harming the spirits of the manor, all were fearsome warriors in life. Only warriors with great strength of arms, he shares, may be able to overcome them.

> [!abstract]+ **Harming the Incorporeal**
> A player who attempts to recall information about harming spirits and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check learns the following information:
> 
> * Spirits and other incorporeal undead are generally immune to elemental and natural forces, including acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder, and poison damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt by nonmagical attacks.
> * Such spirits lose these damage immunities upon entering the Ethereal Plane, where they exist as corporeal beings.
> * Some creatures have developed natural means of counteracting these immunities. For example, the fangs and venom of a **phase spider** are capable of harming spirits on both the Material and Ethereal Plane. 
> * A spellcaster can deal damage to an incorporeal spirit normally by using a phase spider's fang as an additional material component to cast their spells. (The fang isn't consumed when used in this way.)
> * A martial combatant can also deal damage to an incorporeal spirit normally by coating one weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition with phase spider venom or *holy water*. When applied in this way, the venom or *holy water* acts as a contact poison that nullifies the spirit's immunity to the coated weapon, except the coating remains potent for 10 minutes and isn't rendered impotent by touching an incorporeal creature.
>   
> The players can also learn this information automatically by consulting the book *Ethereal Entities* (see [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana]] or [[Arc H - The Lost Soul]]), by asking Dr. Rudolph van Richten after revealing his true identity (see [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana]]), or by asking Ezmerelda d'Avenir after recruiting her (see [[Arc K - The Fallen Abbey]]).

Godfrey notes, however, that these hostile spirits *can* be deceived. If the players feel they need protection from the manor's hostile spirits, Sir Godfrey advises them to travel south from the Luna River Crossroads, to a point where the Luna River briefly becomes a small lake with an island.

"Find an ancient stone slab where the river meets the lake," he directs them. "Two hundred paces west from there, a wide river-rock marks the final resting place of nearly one thousand souls. Some among them may still bear the liveries of the Order. Should you clothe yourselves in their garments, the maddened spirits that haunt these halls shall allow you to come and go in peace." (Godfrey warns, however, that Vladimir himself will not be fooled by any such tricks.)

> [!abstract]+ **The Stone Slab**
> Godfrey isn't sure what the stone slab symbolizes, and knows only that it was placed there by the land's indigenous inhabitants millennia before the Order of the Silver Dragon ever arrived in the valley. "We dealt little with them aside from the occasional trade," he recalls. "Their religion is one of wild places—a faith of beast and root and sky, rather than the dawn of the Morninglord or the shade of Mother Night."

Should the players express interest in retrieving those garments, Godfrey asks only that they treat any uncovered remains with respect and take no more than necessary. "In burying our own dead," he shares, "it was customary to remark: '*May the day's last light guide you home*.' Such sentiment may be still appreciated, even in such a cold and forsaken place."

If the players ask about the origin of the buried remains, Godfrey solemnly informs them that the Order of the Silver Dragon made its final stand there.
### Obtaining the Garments
If the players choose to recover the soldiers' garments from the mass grave on the Luna River, they will first need to obtain shovels to excavate the site, which they can purchase from Arasek Stockyard in Vallaki, borrow from the dusk elves of the Vallakian <span class="citation">N9. Vistani Camp (p. 119)</span>, or borrow from Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov of Krezk.

As the players head south from the Luna River Crossroads after obtaining one or more shovels, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Leaving the crossroads behind, you set a southern course alongside the Luna River. It's not long, however, before a low-lying fog bank swallows up the path, leaving no sign of the river but the muffled echo of its drifting currents.</p>
<p>The canopy of the Svalich Wood looms oppressively on either side, each tree a gnarled ghost that whispers amidst the fog. Ahead, a strange, misshapen shadow lies unmoving across the road.</p>
</div>

The misshapen shadow is the corpse of a **dire wolf**. If the players approach it, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The fog pulls away from the shadow, revealing the broken and battered corpse of an enormous wolf, easily six feet at the shoulder. The wolf's side bears several large puncture wounds, and its head and shoulders appear to have been crushed beneath an incredible weight.</p>
</div>

A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check indicates that the wolf's side was punctured by an enormous pair of antlers—far larger than those belonging to an ordinary elk or deer—and that its head and shoulders were trampled by a similarly large set of hooves.

When the players continue past the wolf corpse, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Several minutes pass before the forest's edge pulls away, and the river's current quiets to the gentle lapping of distant waves.</p>
<p>The path continues south here, away from the water's edge. A few feet ahead, a trail of dark blood vanishes into the eastern fog, heading toward the shore.</p>
</div>

A DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals that the trail of blood is quite recent—no older than an hour. A DC 5 Wisdom (Survival) check uncovers a single enormous hoofprint more than a foot across heading east alongside the blood trail. (A DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check identifies the hoofprint as belonging to an elk, albeit an elk far larger than any ordinary beast.)

If the players follow the trail of blood, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The blood leads to a small peninsula that juts out into the water, the lake's grey waves lapping softly against its shores. In the distance, the shadow of a forlorn isle stands amidst the fog, the silhouettes of tall trees jutting up from its surface like needles.</p>
<p>A mossy stone slab stands near the edge of the peninsula, just under six feet in height. It rests on an old, cracked stone circle, and seems to bear some sort of carving. A raven sits perched atop the slab, its head bowed in silent vigil.</p>
<p>Beside it, lying sprawled along the peninsula with its rear body half-submerged in the lake, is an enormous elk, easily twelve feet tall at the shoulder. Its coat is matted with mud and blood, and its right eye has been torn from the socket, leaving a dark, crimson void behind.</p>
<p>The elk's hind right leg, the one closest to the water, is a horrifying sight. Cuts the width of a human fist have sliced the muscle from the haunches to the thigh, exposing the bone in places where the flesh has been torn away. The flesh around the wound is tinged with sickly shades of black and green, leaking a slow drip of pus and blood into the water below.</p>
<p>The elk's chest rises and falls with shallow, labored breaths, its remaining eye staring blankly into the mists. Above it, the raven croaks softly, the somber sound echoing through the blanket of fog.</p>
</div>

The elk is a **dire elk** (use the statistics of a **giant elk**) with 1 hit point and five levels of exhaustion. A DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals that the wound is infected and gangrenous, and that the elk is close to death. The infected wound can't be healed by any magical means short of a *regeneration* spell.

> [!info]+ **The Raven & the Elk**
> The raven is the Roc of Mount Ghakis in disguise. While in this form, the roc uses the statistics of an ordinary **raven**, except it has an Intelligence score of 15 (+2), a Wisdom score of 20 (+5), a Charisma score of 14 (+2), and the hit points, proficiency bonus, and saving throw proficiencies of a **roc**.
> 
> The **dire elk** is one of Barovia's rarest creatures, and a beast once held sacred to the Huntress of the Ladies Three. If the players speak to the raven using the spell *speak with animals* or similar magic, it introduces itself solemnly as Turul, and shares only that it has come to stand vigil over the elk and mourn its passing.

> [!abstract]+ **The Stone Slab**
> If the players choose to investigate the slab, they find that it bears a carving of a spider over an engraved three-pointed star, the grooves lined with lichen and moss. (The slab is an ancient monument to the Weaver, and the three-pointed star the symbol of the Ladies Three.)
#### The Witch's Harvest
If the players linger by the elk's side, read:

<div class="description">
<p>From the river to the east, a short distance from the water's edge, approaches the hazy silhouette of a humanoid figure astride a bestial shadow as tall as a horse, both obscured beneath the thick, swirling fog. You hear the soft splashing of water, and a distant, resonant rumble.</p>
</div>

A player who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns that the "steed" has the approximate size and proportions of a **dire wolf**, with the rumble resembling a dire wolf's growl.

If the players allow the figure to approach, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The fog parts faintly, and a woman cloaked in mud-splattered robes emerges from its depths. She wears a tattered shawl across her shoulders, a pair of red stones upon her ears, and a carved wooden talisman around her neck. A reed-woven basket sits nestled in the crook of her left arm, covered with a coarse, earth-stained rag. Her right hand, clad in an old, crinkled leather glove, holds a rusted, wicked-looking knife.</p>
<p>The woman rides an enormous dire wolf—but not a living one. The beast's flesh has begun to rot, its side pierced with gaping, bloody wounds, and some of the meat has been stripped away from its front left leg, revealing the white bone underneath. From its perch atop the stone slab, the raven emits a rumbling, guttural croak, its feathers bristling as the undead wolf steps forward.</p>
<p>"I thought this one's wounds looked like a dire elk's antlers," the woman muses, peering over the wolf's ears toward the elk. "This is a lucky day indeed."</p>
</div>

The woman is Wensencia, a student of Baba Lysaga. (Players who previously encountered her in [[Arc I - The Walls of Krezk]] recognize her immediately.) The talisman is her arcane focus. If the rag is removed, it reveals a pile of a half-dozen mandrakes—thick, branched, upright roots with a faint, yet eerie resemblance toward a human form.

> [!info]+ **Wensencia and Her Steed**
> Wensencia is a **Barovian witch** with 33 hit points, a +3 proficiency bonus, and the following spells prepared:
> 
> * Cantrips (at will): mage hand, prestidigitation, ray of frost
> * 1st level (4 slots): ray of sickness, sleep, Tasha's hideous laughter
> * 2nd level (3 slots): enlarge/reduce, invisibility, misty step
> * 3rd level (1 slot remaining): animate dead, gaseous form
>   
> Wensencia's steed has the statistics of a **dire wolf**, but has a **zombie**'s ***undead fortitude*** feature instead of a dire wolf's ***pack tactics*** feature. It obey's Wensencia's spoken commands, and Wensencia can use a bonus action on her turn to mentally command it if it is within 60 feet of her.

> [!profile]+ **Wensencia, Swamp Witch**
> Wensencia, like Baba Lysaga’s five other current students, viewed Strahd’s revival as the coming of a dark messiah, and sought out the swamp witch at the advice of Strahd’s vampiric bride, Ludmilla Vilisevic. She should make the players feel irritated, uncomfortable, intrigued, and insulted, and most often feels annoyed, disinterested, curious, thoughtful, smug, or melancholy.

If the players previously encountered her in [[Arc I - The Walls of Krezk]], Wensencia greets them with muted surprise and annoyance. Wensencia can share the following information with the players, but only if specifically asked:

* She is Wensencia, a student of Mother Lysaga of Berez. (If the players refer to Baba Lysaga as "the swamp witch," Wensencia sneers and instructs them to "refer to Mother Lysaga with respect").
* She was out by the eastern shore of the Luna River picking mandrake roots (as alchemical ingredients) when she found the corpse of a **dire wolf**, evidently killed by a dire elk. Fascinated by the rare prospect of finding a whole, fresh dire wolf corpse, she reanimated it and set off to track down its killer, hopeful that the elk might still be in the vicinity.

Wensencia intends to harvest the dire elk's antlers, heart, and liver for use in Baba Lysaga's alchemical potions and spellwork. Upon arriving, she dismounts her undead dire wolf, grasps her rusted knife more firmly in her gloved hand, and approaches the elk, instructing the players to step away if they're standing in its vicinity. As she does, the raven caws desperately, fluttering its wings and clacking its beak in obvious distress.

If her path forward is clear, she then kneels before the elk's throat and feels for its pulse, remarking that "the beast's heartbeat is impressively strong, even in its final hour." She then shakes her head and leans forward, steadying her grip on the knife and adding, "Still, hopeless defiance is hopeless all the same." Unless prevented by the players, Wensencia then slashes the dire elk's throat with her rusted knife, killing it immediately, and moves to begin harvesting its antlers.

If the players challenge or move to obstruct her, Wensencia is annoyed and slightly perplexed. "The beast is already as good as dead," she notes, coldly. "Why not put it to use? It's no good to anyone wheezing and bleeding on the shore."

Wensencia can't be persuaded to spare the elk's life on its own merits. If the players insist that she allow the elk time to die in its own time, she sniffs that "the beast could take hours to die—and the organs are best harvested while the heart is still beating, regardless."

The players can dissuade Wensencia from harvesting the elk by offering a gift of reasonable value and succeeding on a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the players threaten Wensencia in an attempt to dissuade her, she asks, in bafflement, why they would care so deeply about a "dumb, dying animal." 

Ultimately, the players can also dissuade Wensencia from harvesting the elk by succeeding on a DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check. If the players attack her, she uses her first turn in combat to cast *gaseous form*, vanishing into the fog before returning to Berez. (The undead dire wolf, compelled to defend her, fights the players to the death.)

As Wensencia departs, if the players treated her cordially, she warns them to beware the creatures that lurk amidst the gloom of the nearby crags and woods. "This meadow is a place of ancient death," she says, "and such creatures are drawn to it like moths to a flame. Do not linger long, lest you draw their attention—and their appetites." (Wensencia is referring to the **ghouls** that dwell amidst the cliffs of the nearby mountains, described in further detail below.)

If the players successfully dissuade or drive off Wensencia, the raven clucks gratefully and solemnly bows its head in a showing of respect. If the players linger an additional five minutes, the dire elk passes away, its eyes slowly drifting closed as the wound overtakes it.
#### The Mass Grave
When the players depart the stone slab for the grave site, read:

<div class="description">
<p>You proceed west from the peninsula, treading across soft, loamy soil and through tall, yellowed grasses that whisper against your boots. As you count your paces, it's not long before a wide, grey-brown boulder emerges from the mist, its edges worn smooth from water and wind. It stands alone atop the grassland, a silent sentinel amidst the fog.</p>
</div>

The soldiers' remains are located in a one-hundred foot radius area of earth around the boulder, buried an average of five feet beneath the surface. For each thirty minutes the players dig, roll on the table below to determine what they uncover:

| 1d20 | Remains |
| :--: | ---- |
| 1-7 | Old, scattered bones |
| 8-10 | A full or partial human skeleton |
| 11-15 | An iron shield engraved with the sigil of the Order of the Silver Dragon |
| 16-17 | An iron helm engraved with the sigil of the Order of the Silver Dragon |
| 18 | A silver medallion engraved with the sigil of the Order of the Silver Dragon |
| 19 | A breastplate engraved with the sigil of the Order of the Silver Dragon |
| 20 | Roll twice, ignoring a result of 20. |

When the players have uncovered—but not yet retrieved—the final piece of gear necessary to disguise themselves from the hostile spirits of Argynvostholt, read:

<div class="description">
<p>A damp, easterly wind stirs the swirling fog—bringing with it the thick, rotting stench of death.</p>
</div>

A player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or greater also notices several hunched silhouettes skulking toward their location—two from the east and three from the west.

The stench and silhouettes belong to a pack of five **ghouls**, which smelled the scent of overturned grave-dirt and came lumbering in search of its source. If the players linger or attempt to flee, the ghouls attack. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>Five emaciated, humanoid creatures dressed in rags come hurtling out of the fog, their bloodstained claws outstretched and yellowed, jagged teeth bared in desperate hunger.</p>
</div>

> [!combat]+ **Balancing the Mass Grave** 
> This combat encounter is a **bruising** combat encounter against a party of five 5th-level players and a CR 2 ally (Ireena Kolyana), and will consume approximately 14% of their total maximum hit points. For parties of smaller or larger sizes, modify the encounter as follows: 
> * **Three Players**. Reduce the number of ghouls to four. 
> * **Four Players**. Reduce the number of ghouls to four. 
> * **Six Players**. Increase the number of ghouls to six.

When combat begins, if the players protected the dire elk from Wensencia, secretly roll initiative for the **roc of Mount Ghakis** as well. On its turn, the roc uses a bonus action to assume its gargantuan **roc** form before using its action to grapple one of the **ghouls** with its **talons** attack and departing. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A sudden gale of wind roars in your ears, the fog swirling violently around you. A monstrous silhouette, taller than the trees of the Svalich Wood and with a wingspan twice as wide, descends from the sky above—and so too does a gargantuan set of talons, emerging from the fog toward one of the ghouls like the fingers of a vengeful deity.</p>
<p>Before the ghoul can even react, claws large enough to pluck an elephant from the earth have lashed around it, lifting it effortlessly into the sky. A single shriek bursts from the ghoul's throat—and then the shadowed behemoth is gone, vanishing into the foggy abyss overhead.</p>
</div>

When four of the ghouls have been slain, the fifth throws itself to the ground, bowing before the players and babbling for mercy in broken Common from the "nice, kind masters" in exchange for information. The ghoul, which refers to itself as Nim, promises that "Nim knows many things—many secrets!"

Nim, who occasionally eyes the players' fleshy extremities with hungry interest, should make the players feel disturbed, uncomfortable, or darkly amused, and most often feels hungry, obsessed, sniveling, paranoid, or enraged. Nim is willing to share the following information if the players allow it to leave in peace:

* Long ago, the "hissing water" was much smaller, and the "drowned earth" near here dry and beautiful.
* Then, as now, an old circle of stones stood on the far bank of the "hissing water" by the village, marked with the sigil of the spider. Though Nim didn't see it itself, someone once told it that "the Dark Master" had claimed the stones from their old master. If asked how, Nim shares that the "Dark Master" claimed the stones with the aid of "the wood-people, and their horns and claws." (Nim is referring to the Forest Folk who helped Strahd first desecrate the Swamp Fane. Although Nim doesn't remember it, Nim—then a villager of Berez called Nimira—learned the story from its grandmother, who spied upon the druids' first meeting with Strahd at the Fane.)
*  On "the day the earth drowned," the circle of stones shook, and a great wave burst from the mountains across the river. "Nim ran away," Nim hisses. "Dark things in the water. Didn't dare stay." She adds, weeping, "But so *hungry*." (A player with a passive Wisdom (Insight) score of 8 or more then notices that Nim's tears are false, and that Nim is eyeing the players' flesh through its fingers with conniving, hopeful interest.)
* Recently, the "Dark Master" has begun to visit the circle of stones once again—and each time he does, the circle trembles, though more quietly than it did long ago. The "swamp woman"—Baba Lysaga—has begun visiting it as well, and Nim has observed strange lights and sounds each time she does. (Nim doesn't know what Baba Lysaga is doing there.)

If the **roc** appeared during the fight, Nim can identify it as "the Great Raven," which dwells atop the "cold mountain." Nim isn't sure why it might have attacked.

If allowed to depart, Nim hisses gleefully and scampers off on all fours, vanishing into the mist.

## M4b. Steward’s Wing
### Kitchen
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 7, Area Q10.</em></span>

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">Q10. Kitchen (p. 133).</span> However, the iron pot isn’t rattling when the players first enter the room. Instead, the room is noticeably colder than the surrounding rooms, though not quite freezing.

If a player approaches or crosses in front of the fireplace, read:

<div class="description">
<p>An alien sense of anticipation and childlike excitement suddenly grips you. It’s only after a moment that you realize that the sensation isn’t coming from you, but from something brushing against your mind.</p>
</div>

The emotions are a telepathic communication sent by the spirit of Zorya, Argynvost’s deceased **pseudodragon** familiar, which is hiding in the pot over the fireplace instead of a bat. The sensations fade if the player moves away from the fireplace, and grow stronger if the player moves closer.

> [!lore]+ **Argynvost’s Familiar**
>
> When he came to Barovia, Argynvost brought with him Zorya, a rare silver-scaled **pseudodragon** he had found in the forests of a distant land. An intelligent, if mischievous creature, Zorya served as Argynvost’s loyal companion until her death on the day of Argynvostholt’s fall. In death, she is a shy, if playful spirit, though she mourns Argynvost’s death and subsequent silence.
>
> If found by the players, Zorya attempts to engage them in her favorite game—hide-and-seek—using her ***limited telepathy*** feature to communicate basic emotions, images, and ideas as the game unfolds. Each time the players find her, the following events occur unless the players prevent them:
>
> * Any sensations of anticipation and excitement vanish, to be replaced by sensations of amusement and delight. 
> * Zorya flees into the next chamber and hides herself there.
> * The temperature in the players’ current room returns to normal, and the temperature in Zorya’s new hiding place plummets.
> * The sensations of amusement and delight fade, to be replaced by muted sensations of anticipation and excitement.

If a player moves within reach of the iron pot, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The iron pot suddenly begins to tremble, rattling on its hook and bobbing up and down as though something is inside it. The alien emotions intensify to a nervous, yet excitable giddiness.</p>
</div>

If a player removes the pot’s lid, Zorya—in the form of a wisp of silvery mist—bursts forth from the pot’s interior with a sound like chiming crystal and flees into [[#Servants’ Quarters]]. When she does, the players feel a muted sense of hopeful longing in addition to any other emotions.
### Servants’ Quarters
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 7, Area Q9.</em></span>

This area is as described in <span class="citation">Q9. Servants’ Quarters (p. 133).</span> 

If the players have previously encountered Zorya in the [[#Kitchen]], the room’s temperature is noticeably lower than the nearby rooms and Zorya is hiding beneath the frame of the northeastern bed.

If a player moves within reach of Zorya’s bed, a player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or greater notices the motheaten bed skirts beneath its frame begin to leap and tremble excitedly, the sensations of anticipation and excitement intensifying in the player’s mind. (A player who checks Zorya’s bed notices the moving bed skirts automatically.)

If a player moves the bed skirts to reveal Zorya’s hiding place, Zorya—in the form of a cloud of silvery mist with noticeably reptilian features—bursts forth with a sound like chiming crystal and flees into [[#Parlor]]. When she does, the players feel a diminished sense of longing and a small sense of satisfaction in addition to any other emotions.
### Parlor
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 7, Area Q7.</em></span>

This area is as described in <span class="citation">Q7. Parlor (p. 133).</span>

If the players have previously encountered Zorya in the [[#Servants’ Quarters]], the room’s temperature is noticeably lower than the nearby rooms and Zorya is hiding behind the drapes of the western window.

If a player moves within reach of Zorya’s window, a player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or greater notices the tattered drapes shift and rustle quietly, the sensations of anticipation and excitement intensifying in the player’s mind. (A player who checks Zorya’s window notices the moving drapes automatically.)

If a player moves the drapes to reveal Zorya’s hiding place, Zorya—again in the form of a cloud of silvery mist with noticeably reptilian features—bursts forth with a sound like chiming crystal and flees into [[#Dragon’s Den]]. When she does, the players feel a swelling sense of satisfaction in addition to any other emotions.
### Dragon’s Den
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 7, Area Q6.</em></span>

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">Q6. Dragon’s Den (p. 132).</span> However, the living fire doesn't appear as they approach the fireplace.

If the players have previously encountered Zorya in the [[#Parlor]], the room’s temperature is noticeably lower than the nearby rooms and Zorya is hiding within the wine-cabinet sarcophagus, concealed within a decanter made of frosted glass.

If a player moves within reach of Zorya’s decanter, a player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or greater notices a small, winged shadow fidgeting impatiently behind the glass, the sensations of anticipation and excitement intensifying in the player’s mind. (A player who checks Zorya’s decanter notices the moving shadow automatically.)

If a player unstops the decanter to reveal Zorya’s hiding place, she bursts forth with a trill of delight and plunges into the fireplace. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A fire of silver flames erupts in the dead hearth and assumes a draconic form. It hisses and crackles - and then yawns, stretches, and unfurls its smoky wings as a familiar sound like chiming crystal pours forth from its tiny throat.</p>
</div>

![[Zorya.png]]
<span class="credit">"Zorya" by Caleb Cleveland. Support him on <a href="https://patreon.com/calebisdrawing/">Patreon!</a></span>

If the players don’t immediately respond, Zorya chirps happily and flutters up into the air before attempting to settle on the shoulder of whichever player most befriended her during the game. (Though made of fire, Zorya’s body is cold to the touch, not hot.) 

Once befriended in this way, Zorya remains with the players while they remain within Argynvostholt unless driven away. The revenants and spirits of Argynvostholt won’t attack Zorya, though she aids the players in battle where possible.

> [!abstract]+ **Zorya's Assistance**
> If the players convey to Zorya their intent to seek out the insight of other spirits in the mansion, Zorya guides the players beneath one of the den's rotted divans, where a small brass key has fallen between one of the divan's legs and the wall. (The key unlocks the doors to the [[#Knights’ Quarters]].)
> 
> If asked which door the key unlocks, Zorya is happy to guide the players to the [[#Knights’ Quarters]], though she responds with obvious distress and surprise should the **phantom warriors** there attack.

### Wine Storage
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 7, Area Q11.</em></span>

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">Q11. Wine Storage (p. 133).</span> However, the dusk elf Savid is not present. Instead, add the following text to the end of this area’s description:

<div class="description">
<p>An old purple stain covers much of the far half of the stone floor, faded and discolored with age. A rusted crowbar sits against the wall not far away.</p>
</div> 

A player who inspects the stain and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check determines that it appears to have originated from the northeastern barrel.

The northeastern barrel appears to be empty. However, a player who uses the crowbar or another tool to open the barrel finds a small pouch crafted of chainmail sitting inside. The pouch contains two silver rings. Each ring is a plain silver band with the words “From this to the end of days" engraved around the inside of the ring.

> [!lore]+ **The Rings**
> The two rings are wedding rings, and belonged to Vladimir Horngaard and Sir Godfrey Gwilym. Vladimir and Godfrey hid these rings here on the night before their deaths, unwilling to allow Strahd to loot them and vowing to return to retrieve them if victorious. However, undeath has robbed both men of their memory of the rings, as well as the love they shared in life. 
> 
> If shown the rings, Godfrey notes only, with mild interest, that the rings' engraving appears to be excerpted from the oath of the Order of the Silver Dragon, which is described further in [[#Knights of the Order]].

A player who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check in this room notices an old leather satchel encased in webbing in the upper northwest corner of the room, near the ceiling. (A player who takes one minute to survey the room spots the satchel automatically.)

The satchel, which appears to have had its leather strap forcibly torn off, contains two vials of *holy water* and a book titled *The Oath Celestial*, which is as described in <span class="citation">Q40. Argynvost’s Study (p. 140)</span>. A simple leather bookmark engraved with the sigil of the Morninglord—a rising sun—marks the place of a passage within the book titled *Prayer for the Departed.* It reads as follows:

> * **Four Players**. Reduce the number of phantom warriors to four. 
> * **Six Players**. Increase the number of phantom warriors to six.

Note that, in combat, a **phantom warrior** can attack from above a player using its fly (hover) speed, but can't attack through walls.

If all players appear to be wearing garments or gear bearing the insignia of the Order of the Silver Dragon, either illusory or obtained from [[#The Mass Grave]], the warriors silently nod and vanish once more into the Ethereal Plane, allowing the players to pass in peace.

If some, but not all of the players appear to be wearing garments or gear bearing the insignia of the Order of the Silver Dragon, one of the phantom warriors tightens her grip upon her sword and asks the players to explain why they have allowed outsiders to enter Argynvostholt. "The Devil's forces are at our gates," the spirit growls. "Do you not understand that a single infiltrator could bring our resistance to its knees?" 

The players can convince the spirit to allow any "outsiders" to pass with a successful DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) check. Otherwise, the phantom warriors deem the players potential traitors and attack.

If none of the players appear to be wearing garments or gear bearing the insignia of the Order of the Silver Dragon, the phantom warriors immediately attack. 

On initiative count 20 of the first round of combat, if the players freed any of the trapped spirits of Strahd’s soldiers in [[#M3c. Chapel of Morning]], up to two of those spirits manifest as **specters** bearing spears and horned helmets to defend the players in gratitude. Instead of their ***life drain***, each specter gains the following attack:

* ***Spectral Spear.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) force damage.

In battle, the **phantom warriors** shout “Death to the invaders!", “For Argynvost!", and “Remember Horngaard!" The phantom warriors are spirits of soldiers who fell defending the mansion against Strahd’s armies. Cursed to relive the memory of that day while Vladimir Horngaard’s hatred binds them to Barovia, they can’t be stopped or reasoned with.

When the **phantom warriors** are defeated, any surviving **specters** warmly nod to the players, then vanish. The temperature in the corridor then returns to normal.
### Knights’ Quarters
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 7, Areas Q27 and Q28.</em></span>

These areas are largely as described in <span class="citation">Q27. Knights’ Quarters (p. 136)</span> and <span class="citation">Q28. Knights’ Quarters (p. 136)</span>. However, the four *potions of invulnerability* in <span class="citation">Q28. Knights’ Quarters (p. 136)</span> are instead *potions of greater healing* (<span class="citation">Dungeon Master’s Guide, p. 187</span>).

In addition, <span class="citation">Q27. Knights’ Quarters (p. 136)</span> is haunted by the spirit of Minodora Taltos, a **poltergeist** that once served as a clerk to the Order of the Silver Dragon in the war against Strahd. When the players first enter this room, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The temperature plummets unnaturally beyond the threshold, your breath puffing out in small clouds of fog that linger momentarily before dissipating. A thin layer of frost dims the grey light filtering through the old, cracked windows, and a deep chill seems to pervade the room.</p>
</div>

When one or more players fully enter this room for the first time, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Four of the room’s five windows abruptly slam open, and a cold wind howls through the room. Large letters begin to emerge in the frost on the still-closed eastern window, each one meticulously and neatly formed: “IF YOU BE SERVANTS OF THE DEVIL, BEGONE."</p>
</div>

The words are a warning sent by Minodora. The players can convince her that they aren’t Strahd’s soldiers with a successful DC 5 Charisma (Persuasion) check, succeeding automatically if they inform her of their relationship with Sir Godfrey or their purpose in the mansion.

Minodora is a solemn, if black-humored spirit. If befriended by the players, she can share the following information via frost-shaped words on the eastern window:

* In life, she served as a clerk to the Order of the Silver Dragon during the wars against Strahd. She died on the day Strahd’s forces broke into Argynvostholt, just a day after Commander Vladimir Horngaard and Sir Godfrey Gwilym perished in an assault on Strahd’s camp.
* The **phantom warriors** in the mansion are the spirits of soldiers who died to Strahd’s attack, cursed to relive their memories of that day for eternity. (Minodora doesn’t know why they’re cursed.)
* She doesn’t know anything about Argynvost’s whisperings. However, she knows that the spirit of Brother Marek, the Order’s former chaplain, keeps an ear and eye out for everything that happens in the spiritual realm of Argynvostholt.

> [!info]+ **Roleplaying Minodora**
> Minodora prefers to use short, sparse messages of one to four words each wherever possible, and won't volunteer information unless specifically asked for it. For example, she might begin a conversation with the players as follows:
> 
> **Q. Who are you?**
> A. Minodora.
> 
> **Q. Who were you in life? Were you a member of the Order of the Silver Dragon?**
> A. Somewhat.
> 
> **Q. Were you a knight?**
> A. No.
> 
> **Q. What did you do with the Order?**
> A. I was a clerk.
> 
> **Q. How did you die?**
> A. Invaders.

Minodora is glad to provide the players with directions to Brother Marek’s preferred haunting place, <span class="citation">Q35. Upstairs Gallery (p. 138)</span>. She warns them, however, that Brother Marek prefers to remain within the Ethereal Plane wherever possible. To draw his attention, she advises, the players might wish to retrieve his holy book—which he kept in a leather satchel in his bedroom in the western chamber of <span class="citation">Q19. Ruined Bedchambers (p. 135)</span>—and read aloud one of the prayers contained therein.
## M5c. Southern Chambers
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 7, Area Q19.</em></span>

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">Q19. Ruined Bedchambers (p. 135)</span>. However, add the following text to the end of the western room’s description:

<div class="description">
<p>Long, thick webs stretch from the eastern wall, down past the collapsed floor to the space below. Something seems to be protruding from the wall behind the webbing.</p>
</div>

If the players haven't yet defeated the spiders in [[#M4c. Spiders’ Ballroom]], add the following text to the end of each room’s description:

<div class="description">
<p>As you survey the room, you hear a faint, irregular clicking from the space beneath the floor, followed by the soft scratching of something unseen.</p>
</div>

The object protruding from the wall in the western room is a rusted iron hook bearing a torn leather strap. (The strap once belonged to the leather satchel in [[#M4c. Spiders’ Ballroom]], but was torn off when a **giant spider** took the satchel and its contents as a trophy.) Both the hook and strap are strewn with thick webs and can’t be identified without approaching.

A creature must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity (Stealth) check, made with disadvantage due to the creaking floor, to walk across the floor without alerting the spiders below. A creature that fails this check, or which cuts, damages, or otherwise disturbs the webbing attracts a single **giant spider** from [[#M4c. Spiders’ Ballroom]], which crawls up into the room and attacks. (The other six **giant spiders** remain in the ballroom below.)
## M5d. Upper Chapel
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 7, Areas Q14 and Q24.</em></span>

These areas are as described in <span class="citation">Q14. Chapel Staircases (p. 134)</span> and <span class="citation">Q24. Chapel Balcony (p. 136)</span>. However, the chapel below is as described in [[#M3c. Chapel of Morning]].
# M6. Third Floor
## M6a. Halls of the Order
#### Knights of the Order
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 7, Areas Q37 and Q38 (p. 139).</em></span>

These areas are largely as described in <span class="citation">Q37 Knights of the Order (p. 139)</span> and <span class="citation">Q38. Closet (p. 139)</span>. However, remove the final sentence of the area’s description. (No **revenants** sit in the chairs around the table.) Instead, add the following to the end of this area’s description:

<div class="description">
<p>An inscription appears to be carved into the wood around the circumference of the table.</p>
</div>

The inscription is written in elegant calligraphy and interwoven with aged, intricate carvings of dragons and knights. It reads as follows:

<div class="description">
<p>I solemnly vow to uphold the virtues of the Order of the Silver Dragon, with honor as my shield and truth as my guide.</p>
<p>In the shadow of evil, I shall be the light; in the face of despair, the beacon of hope. No challenge shall shake my resolve; no defeat shall quell my heart. With sword and spirit, I shall stand against darkness and forge a brighter dawn.</p>
<p>So do I swear in the name of the Silver Dragon, from this to the end of days.</p>
</div>

#### Vladimir’s Bedroom
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 7, Area Q39.</em></span>

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">Q39. Vladimir’s Bedroom (p. 140)</span>. However, remove the four sentences describing the bear, the dire wolf, and the empty chest. Instead, add the following text to the end of the area’s description:

<div class="description">
<p>An old portrait hangs on the wall above the bed.</p>
</div>

If a player inspects the portrait, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The portrait, its once-vibrant canvas faded and tearing, depicts two men in fine clothes standing side-by-side. Gleaming longswords hang from their hips, and their gloved hands are tightly clasped together. One man is tall and silver-haired, the other dark-haired and stocky, but both of their faces are featureless, bearing only smooth, unblemished skin.</p>
</div>

A player who studies the portrait and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check recognizes that the men’s builds are recognizably similar to those of Sir Godfrey Gwilym and (if they have met him) Commander Vladimir Horngaard.

> [!lore]+ **The Portrait**
> The portrait once depicted Commander Vladimir Horngaard and his husband, Sir Godfrey Gwilym. However, their faces vanished from the portrait after the Order’s resurrection, Vladimir’s blinding hatred for Strahd causing both knights to forget the love they shared in life.
#### Argynvost’s Study
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 7, Areas Q40 and Q41.</em></span>

These areas are largely as described in <span class="citation">Q40. Argynvost’s Study (p. 140)</span> and <span class="citation">Q41. Dragon’s Vault (p. 140)</span>. However, the copy of *The Oath Celestial* is no longer present. In addition, the slashed picture is nonmagical, and repairing it has no additional effect.

Revise Argynvost’s journal page to read as follows:

<div class="description">
<p>My knights have fallen, and this land is lost. The armies of my enemy will not be stopped by sword or spell, claw or fang. Today I will die, not avenging those who have fallen, but defending that which I love—this valley, this home, and the ideals of the Order of the Silver Dragon.</p>
<p>The evil surrounds me. The time has come to throw off this guise and show these heathens my true fearsome form. Let it spark terror in their hearts! Let them tell their stories of dark triumph against the protector of the Balinok Mountains! Let Argynvost be remembered as a dragon of honor and valor.</p>
<p>I do not fear death. I have laid down my trappings beneath the tower's watchful gaze, so that others may carry my legacy in my stead. Though my body will die, my spirit will live on where the oath and fire of the Silver Dragon survive. Let it serve as a beacon of light against the darkness. Let it bring hope to a land fraught with despair.</p>
<p>Now, to battle!</p>

<span class="credit">"Argynvost's Journal" by Caleb Cleveland. Support him on <a href="https://patreon.com/calebisdrawing/">Patreon!</a></span>

If the players inspect the slashed picture, revise the first sentence of its description to read as follows:

<div class="description">
<p>The picture hangs askew in its place on the wall. It shows the mansion in better days, under clear winter skies with snow-capped mountains in the background.</p>
</div>

The space behind the image of the chapel in the picture radiates three magical auras under the scrutiny of a *detect magic* spell. Two of the auras belong to the school of abjuration. (The third aura has no school of magic.)

Removing the picture from the wall reveals a hidden stone shelf containing a parchment scroll, a silver bracelet, a small block of white stone, a silver tablet, and a banner.  In addition, the silver hilt of a rapier is nestled against a small hole in the mortar at the back of the compartment, though the blade appears to be concealed within the wall.

The bracelet is carved to resemble a dragon biting its own tail, and is a *bracelet of warding*. The block of white stone, which bears the carving of a dragon’s head and is mounted on a leather cord, is an *amulet of knight’s passage*. The rapier, which has a silvered blade and a hilt carved with the images of tiny dragons, has the properties of a *moon-touched rapier* (<span class="citation">Xanathar's Guide to Everything, p. 138</span>)

> [!item]+ **Bracelet of Warding**
> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
>
> This bracelet has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use a bonus action to spend 1 of its charges to cast the *sanctuary* spell (DC 15), or 2 of its charges to cast the *warding bond* spell with a range of 30 feet.
>
> You can cast one of these spells as a reaction in response to an enemy attacking a creature within range. If you do, you must spend an additional charge, and the spell must target the attacked creature. When cast in this way, the spell's effects end at the start of your next turn.
>
> The bracelet regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If you expend the bracelet's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the bracelet loses its magical properties.

> [!item]+ **Amulet of Knight’s Passage**
> This carved block of white stone is a key that allows passage through the gatehouse at Tsolenka Pass. If a creature presents the stone to the <span class="citation">T3. Curtain of Green Flame (p. 157)</span>, the curtain is suppressed for 1 minute. While the curtain is suppressed in this way, the petrified **vrocks** described in <span class="citation">T2. Demon Statues (p. 157)</span> don’t animate or attack.
> 
> The scrutiny of an *identify* spell reveals only that the block is a key of some kind, though not what for.

The tablet, which bears a copy of the oath of the Order of the Silver Dragon, reads as follows:

<div class="description">
<p>I solemnly vow to uphold the virtues of the Order of the Silver Dragon, with honor as my shield and truth as my guide.</p>
<p>In the shadow of evil, I shall be the light; in the face of despair, the beacon of hope. No challenge shall shake my resolve; no defeat shall quell my heart. With sword and spirit, I shall stand against darkness and forge a brighter dawn.</p>
<p>So do I swear in the name of the Silver Dragon, from this to the end of days.</p>
</div>

When a player inspects the banner, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Silver tassels fringe the edges of this dark-colored banner, the fabric a rich azure that mirrors the twilight sky. Dominating the center is a beautifully detailed silver dragon outlined in intricate silver thread, its wings unfurled in mid-flight.</p>
</div>

The scroll is a letter and reads as follows:

<div class="description">
<p>To Lord Argynvost, Protector of the Balinok Mountains and Founder of the Order of the Silver Dragon,</p>
<p>You have stood as a bulwark against the darkness—a shining example of righteousness and courage. Yet I write to you today with a heavy heart and a burdened soul, fearful that Markovia's counsel will lead your Order down a path that ends in darkness and devastation.</p>
<p>I confess that Lord Von Zarovich is imperfect, as all men inevitably are. Yet his leadership has brought stability and order to a land fraught with chaos, and restored songs of prayer to halls once consigned to madness.</p>
<p>It is therefore with great humility and respect that I implore you and your knights to lay down their arms and make peace. Further bloodshed will tear this land asunder, bringing suffering to the innocent and guilty alike. But with the aid of your wisdom and grace, I do not doubt that we may together forge a brighter dawn.</p>
<p>Faithfully yours,</p>
<p>Andral</p>

<div class="description">
<p>Several empty stone shelves dot the walls between the windows.</p>
</div>

> [!lore]+ **The Empty Shelves**
> These empty shelves once held a few dozen trinkets, oddities, and valuables that Argynvost found particularly interesting or endearing. All were looted long ago.

These areas are largely as described in <span class="citation">Q33. Collapsed Ceiling (p. 138)</span> and <span class="citation">Q36. Dragon’s Audience Hall (p. 138)</span>. However, Vladimir Horngaard is not in the throne in <span class="citation">Q36. Dragon’s Audience Hall</span>, and no **phantom warriors** linger there.

### Ruined Antechamber
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 7, Area Q34 (p. 138).</em></span>

This area replaces <span class="citation">Q34. Ruined Bathroom (p. 138)</span>. When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="description">
<p>This room has a wooden floor warped and scuffed with age. Rusted blades hang between torn banners bearing the emblem of a silver dragon, the dragon's eyes seeming to gaze mournfully upon the broken furnishings below. A torn curtain hangs in an open doorway in the center of the east wall.</p>
</div>

### Upstairs Gallery
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 7, Area Q35.</em></span>

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">Q35. Upstairs Gallery (p. 138)</span>. However, add the following text to the end of this area’s description:

<div class="description">
<p>The left- and right-side windows depict two humans—an older man and a younger woman—kneeling in supplication, while the central window depicts a handsome male angel descending from the heavens between them. The man watches with reverent eyes as the angel bestows a small silver statuette upon the woman, whose eyes are closed in evident prayer. The statuette appears to glow with the same sunlight that encircles the angel’s head.</p>
</div>

Any player who’s previously met the Abbot of the Abbey of Saint Markovia recognizes an uncanny resemblance between the Abbot and the figure in the central window. A player with a passive Wisdom (Insight) score of 15 or greater notices that the man’s gaze appears to be envious, rather than reverent.

> [!lore]+ **The Stained-Glass Windows**
> The stained-glass windows portray the anointing of Saint Markovia as a prophet by Ithuriel, the **deva** of the Morninglord now known as the Abbot. The event was overseen by Saint Andral, the Moste High Priest of the Morninglord’s church at the time of Markovia’s selection, and Markovia’s envious competitor for the title of the Morninglord’s prophet.
>
> The statuette is the *Icon of Dawn's Grace*, which appears as described in <span class="citation">Icon of Ravenloft (p. 222)</span>. The statuette’s glow is a symbolic representation of the shard of the Abbot’s divinity that dwells within.

If the players are accompanied by the **pseudodragon** spirit Zorya, Zorya breathes silver fire upon two ancient torches flanking the stained-glass windows, setting them alight with cold silver flames that bathe the room in a chill, ethereal light.

If the players read aloud a prayer from [[#M4c. Spiders’ Ballroom|The Oath Celestial]], the spirit of Brother Marek speaks to them through the stained-glass form of Saint Andral. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>The figure in the left stained-glass window begins to stir, hues of orange and azure tracing the lines of its form. The man’s arms raise, the glass of his fingers seeming to flex and twitch within the confines of the window. He slowly rises to his feet, his gaze turning to meet yours with a quiet, somber solemnity.</p>
<p>When the stained-glass man speaks, his voice is distant and echoing, and the window’s glass seems to rattle and tremble in resonance. “This husk is as cold as I recall," he murmurs. “Why do you fill its broken halls with benedictions it forsook?"</p>
</div>

> [!profile]+ **Brother Marek**
> In death, Brother Marek is a cold, apathetic shell of a man. His once-jovial cheer has wizened to a dry, sarcastic cynicism, and he views the Order’s fates as damnation for their failures. However, he is not without compassion, and truly wishes the players nothing but the best—so long as they abandon their foolish efforts to stir up the spirits of Argynvostholt. Brother Marek’s spirit should make the players feel irritated, insulted, and sympathetic, and most often feels melancholy, annoyed, skeptical, bitter, resigned, bemused, or disapproving.

The stained-glass man can identify himself as the spirit of Brother Marek. He can share the following information if asked:

* In life, he was the chaplain of the Order of the Silver Dragon. He perished defending the third-floor corridor when the forces of Strahd von Zarovich assaulted the mansion on the final day of the war.
* The stained-glass figure he is possessing is a depiction of Saint Andral, once the Moste High Priest of the Church of the Morninglord. The other two stained-glass figures are the angel Ithuriel and Saint Markovia, respectively. The stained-glass windows depict Saint Markovia’s anointment as a prophet of the Morninglord, in which Ithuriel placed a shard of his divinity in the icon he bestowed upon her. 
* If the players note Saint Andral’s apparent envy, Brother Marek agrees that many rumors once suggested that Saint Andral, who reinvigorated the Church’s power and reach after bestowing the crown of Old Zarovia upon King Barov von Zarovich II, was not pleased with the Morninglord’s decision to anoint Markovia instead of himself. (If asked, Brother Marek can share that King Barov von Zarovich II was named for King Barov I, the ancient founder of the kingdom of Old Zarovia, and that Strahd von Zarovich was the son of King Barov II.)

Brother Marek is reluctant to share information regarding Argynvost’s spirit with the players, believing that the old dragon has “earned his rest," and that further contact with the living will only torment his ghost.

Brother Marek is glad to share his belief that the Order’s fate is damnation for their failure to defend the valley from evil—Strahd’s invasion—and that no force can ever return light and hope to the valley. If the players push back, he replies, bitterly and intensely: “I have stood knee deep in mud and bone, and filled my lungs with pyres’ ash. I have seen knights of valor fall, oaths shattered with their bodies and blades. I have dug trenches for the refugees; I have prayed for their deliverance, and waited for salvation that never came. Hope? Hope is but a lie on the wind—a worm that devours the hearts of men. There is no escape from this Hell while Strahd von Zarovich yet lives."[^1]

[^1]: Inspired by *Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs*

If the players insist that they intend to destroy Strahd von Zarovich, Brother Marek barks a bitter laugh. “Better warriors than you have marched on Castle Ravenloft," he remarks, “and yet their work has only swelled the ranks of the dead, while the vampire still rules from his shadowed towers. When the Order’s dead marched on Castle Ravenloft four centuries ago, the seer Madam Eva told them that this land had become an eternal prison, forever bound in the Mists. What hope have you, where so many have failed?"

The players can convince Brother Marek to give them an opportunity to speak with Argynvost by making a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, with advantage if they mention Godfrey's request or their defeat of Volenta Popofsky in [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast]] or Ludmilla Vilisevic in [[Arc J - The Stolen Gem]]. The check also succeeds automatically if the players reference any part of Madam Eva’s Tarokka reading, such as their possession of the *Tome of Strahd* or Madam Eva’s foretelling of the *Sunsword* and its location.

> [!abstract]+ **Legacy of the Sunsword**
> If told of the *Sunsword*’s foretelling, Brother Marek stirs in shock. He can inform the players that he once heard of a similar sword—King Barov II’s *Brightblade*, an enchanted sword that glowed with the light of the sun. “Strahd von Zarovich never wielded it in battle against us," he says, thoughtfully. “I had heard rumors that it had been passed down to Barov’s younger son, then rumors it had been destroyed. If it still exists, it may be one of the only weapons capable of destroying the beast that Zarovich has become."
>
> If told of the “amber doors" referenced in the *Sunsword*’s foretelling, Brother Marek’s eyes widen. The players can convince him to share the existence of the Amber Temple with a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, though Brother Marek—who never visited the temple himself—knows only that it once served as a prison for terrible evils, and that it can be found somewhere on Mount Ghakis. He doesn’t know how the *Sunsword* may have arrived there, nor where it may be found within.
#### Marek is Convinced
If convinced by the players to aid them in speaking with Argynvost, Brother Marek advises them: “Seek out the younger of the twin dragons above. Reignite the silver flame it once wielded, and remind it of the oath it once served. Do this, and the memory of the Silver Dragon may return to fill it once more." He then bids the players farewell and good luck and returns the stained-glass figure to its original kneeling position. Brother Marek’s spirit then departs, freezing the figure in place.

> [!abstract]+ **Zorya's Flames**
> If the players are unaccompanied by Argynvost's familiar, the ghostly **pseudodragon** Zorya, modify Brother Marek's first sentence to read: "Seek out the silver dragon's shadow below, and the younger of the twin dragons above."

> [!info]+ **The Younger Dragon**
> Marek's mention of "twin dragons" refers to the dragon gargoyles that overlook the roof of the manor, one of which can now be found in <span class="citation">Q53. Beacon of Argynvostholt (p. 142)</span>. 
#### Marek is Unconvinced
If the players fail to convince Brother Marek to allow them to speak with Argynvost, he scoffs, but offers to provide them a final chance. "Lord Argynvost's tomb lies empty in the graveyard below," he informs them. "Should he hear your words, he may grant you a token of his favor. Bring me proof of that favor, and I shall give you the guidance you seek."

If the players subsequently descend to <span class="citation">Q16. Dragon’s Mausoleum (p. 134)</span>, it is as described in [[#M4a. Cemetery]] above. To obtain a token of Argynvost's favor, one or more players must deliver a courageous, truthful, and honorable speech regarding their intention to defeat Strahd and free Barovia. To encourage them to do so, Argynvost's spirit kindles the torches within the mausoleum as follows:

* **Argynvost Somewhat Approves.** The torches briefly flicker with cold silver embers, which are swiftly extinguished.
* **Argynvost Approves.** The torches briefly flare with cold silver fire, which then dwindles into nothingness.
* **Argynvost Strongly Approves.** The torches ignite with cold, roaring silver fire and gain the effects of a _continual flame_ spell.

Each torch can be easily removed from its mount. If the players return to the [[#Upstairs Gallery]] and show an ignited torch to Brother Marek, he emerges once more from his stained-glass window to provide them with the guidance in [[#Marek is Convinced]] above before disappearing.

<div class="description">
<p>As the old wooden door creaks open, grey light floods the darkened landing—and a shimmering ethereal arrow pierces the stone floor before you.

</div>

The tower is one of <span class="citation">Q52. Beacon Turrets (p. 141)</span>. The spectral figure is one of the two **phantom warriors** that occupy the turrets.

However, the dragon gargoyle isn’t magical, and doesn’t whisper aloud when the players pass in front of it. In addition, a player who approaches or inspects <span class="citation">Q46. Destroyed Ballista (p. 141)</span> notices that it appears to have been pointed at <span class="citation">Q53. Beacon of Argynvostholt (p. 142)</span> before its destruction. (A player who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices that the tower stonework where the destroyed ballista is pointing is broken and crushed, as if gouged by an enormous set of claws.)

If the players, while all are wearing garments or gear bearing the insignia of the Order of the Silver Dragon, identify themselves as members or soldiers of the Order and succeed on a DC 11 Charisma (Deception) check, the two **phantom warriors** in <span class="citation">Q52. Beacon Turrets (p. 141)</span> demand the players speak Commander Horngaard's password before allowing them to approach <span class="citation">Q49. Beacon Tower Door (p. 141)</span>. 

If the players fail to speak the password ("From this until the end of days"), or if any of the visible players aren't wearing garments or gear bearing the Order's insignia, the phantom warriors attack the players on sight, making ***spectral longbow*** attacks against any living character within their line of sight. (The **phantom warriors** have 16 (+3) Dexterity, and their ***spectral longbow*** attacks have +5 to hit and deal 7 (1d8 + 3) force damage on a hit.) A character can escape their line of sight by taking cover behind the mansion’s central roof, the turrets containing <span class="citation">Q31. East Staircases (p. 138)</span>, <span class="citation">Q47. Roof Turrets (p. 141)</span>.

The interior of the beacon’s tower is largely as described in <span class="citation">Q50. Beacon, Lower Landing (p. 141)</span>, <span class="citation">Q51. Beacon, Upper Landing (p. 141)</span>, and <span class="citation">Q52. Beacon Turrets (p. 141)</span>, except for the changes to the **phantom warriors** described above. 

In addition, if any characters successfully enter the tower, the **phantom warriors** exit the beacon turrets and engage the characters on the stairs connecting  <span class="citation">Q50. Beacon, Lower Landing (p. 141)</span> and <span class="citation">Q51. Beacon, Upper Landing (p. 141)</span>. When they do, they gain the following additional reaction, which they use in an effort to lure the players onto the trapped landing on <span class="citation">Q51. Beacon, Upper Landing (p. 141)</span>:

* ***Pivot.*** In response to an enemy missing an attack against it, the phantom warrior moves up to 10 feet away without triggering opportunity attacks.

As they fight in melee, the phantom warriors shout: “Begone, soldiers of the Devil!", “We will die proudly," and “Argynvostholt will never be yours."
## M7b. Beacon
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 7, Area Q53.</em></span>

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">Q53. Beacon of Argynvostholt (p. 142)</span>. However, remove the sentence describing the ravens from the area’s description. (No ravens roost here.) Instead, add the following text to the end of the area’s description:

<div class="description">
<p>A small, silver-plated gargoyle, shaped like a dragon wyrmling and holding a tarnished brazier in its claws, crouches on the floor just beside the staircase landing, its wings curled tightly toward itself. Not far away, a knight in old, rusted armor stands by the western window, looking out across the misted landscape far beyond. The blade of a tall, gleaming greatsword rests on the ground beside him, with one of the knight’s rusted iron gauntlets resting upon its hilt.</p>
</div>

The gargoyle is half the size of <span class="citation">Q44. Dragon Gargoyle (p. 141)</span>. The knight is Vladimir Horngaard, who is as described in <span class="citation">Q36. Dragon’s Audience Hall (p. 138)</span>.
### Meeting Vladimir Horngaard
The players must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check to ascend the staircase without alerting Vladimir to their presence. If the players don’t approach stealthily, fail their Dexterity (Stealth) check, approach the dragon gargoyle, or fought the **phantom warriors** in the turrets below, Vladimir is alerted. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>The gauntleted hand tightens its grip around the greatsword’s hilt, and the knight’s deep, rasping voice pierces the silence. "Who goes there?" it commands. “Be warned—if you are thieves or assassins, know that you shall soon join your quarries in death."</p>

> [!profile]+ **Vladimir Horngaard**
> **Roleplaying Information**
> ***Resonance.*** Vladimir should inspire unease and discomfort with his suspicion and paranoia, (restrained) anger with his apathy for the plight of the Barovian people, and pity for the ways in which his rage and pain have blinded him.
> 
> ***Emotions.*** Vladimir most often feels suspicious, enraged, irritated, placid, stoic, or apathetic.
> 
> ***Motivations.*** Vladimir wants to preserve Strahd's prison in the Mists to avenge his desecration of Argynvost's corpse and the destruction of the Order of the Silver Dragon.
> 
> ***Inspirations.*** When playing Vladimir, channel Stannis Baratheon (*Game of Thrones*), Frank Castle (*The Punisher*), and Rorschach (*Watchmen*).
> 
> **Character Information**
> ***Persona.*** To the world, Vladimir is a cruel, apathetic, and self-righteous creature consumed by vengeance and hatred.
> 
> ***Morale.*** In a fight, Vladimir would gladly take up arms against any person that insulted, disobeyed, or threatened him.
> 
> ***Relationships.*** Vladimir is the commander of the Order of the Silver Dragon, the source of the other revenants' undeath (through the oath they swore him), and the husband of Sir Godfrey Gwilym (whose relationship to him Vladimir has forgotten).

Vladimir aims to interrogate the players sufficiently to confirm their purpose and uncover any inconsistencies or holes in their story. Ultimately, the players can convince Vladimir that they are neither thieves nor assassins with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check or DC 14 Charisma (Deception) check, automatically succeeding on a Charisma (Persuasion) check if they truthfully inform Vladimir that they are investigating the stirrings of Argynvost’s spirit. On a failure, Vladimir warns them that they have one opportunity to flee the mansion before he slays them. If the players fail to plead their case or depart, Vladimir attacks.

If the players convince Vladimir that they are neither thieves nor assassins, Vladimir turns to face them. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>The terrible sound of scraping metal fills the air, and the knight turns to face you, revealing a pale-skinned corpse with burning red eyes in a sunken, skeletal face.</p>
<p>"Neither thieves nor assassins—and yet, you are here." He narrows his eyes, and the blade of his greatsword glints dangerously. “Tell me, then, why the living have come to disturb the dead."
</div>

If asked, Vladimir can share the following information:

* His name is Vladimir Horngaard. In life, he was the commander of the Order of the Silver Dragon, the “valiant order" to which he devoted his life. He perished defending this valley from evil over four centuries ago; because of his failure, he is forever doomed.
* There is no monster Vladimir hates more than Strahd von Zarovich, an invader and tyrant who slew Argynvost and destroyed the Order of the Silver Dragon.
* Vladimir has forbidden his knights from killing Strahd or aiding his defeat because he believes Strahd must suffer eternally for his sins in a hell of his own creation, from which Strahd can never escape. “He sacrificed everything for his empire—faith, love, and youth," Vladimir growls. “Now, everything he ever wanted and everything he ever won is locked away beyond the mists, leaving him trapped in this land of ghosts." (Vladimir doesn’t know who or what the Dark Powers are, but believes that “dark powers" far greater than Strahd have seen fit to punish him for his crimes—a sentence that Vladimir is proud to uphold.)
* Because Strahd, a conqueror, craves adversaries to overcome, Vladimir has also forbidden his knights from slaying Strahd’s minions and creatures, a decision he believes will drive Strahd mad with boredom and despair. (If challenged with the suffering of the Barovian people, Vladimir snarls:  “I would let a thousand nations burn if Strahd von Zarovich would choke on the ashes.")

> [!abstract]+ **Vladimir & Godfrey**
> Vladimir can’t remember the love he shared with Sir Godfrey Gwilym in life, and angrily denies any insinuations otherwise. If confronted with the rings from [[#Wine Storage]] or the portrait from [[#Vladimir’s Bedroom]], Vladimir is obviously disturbed and thrown off balance. However, he insists that such things prove nothing, and that the players mock him and the Order with their lies. “There is no room for love in the war we fight," he snarls. “We are knights, born only to die in the battle against evil. This is how it has always been, and how it will always be."

> [!lore] **Vladimir and Argynvost**
> Vladimir's anger and hatred prevent him from hearing Argynvost's voice. If the players mention anyone communicating with Argynvost's spirit, he claims they are lying. As Argynvost's commander, Vladimir is convinced that if he has not heard Argynvost's spirit, then no one will have, and is unable to be persuaded otherwise.

If the players mention an interest in Argynvost’s spirit, Vladimir asks them coldly if “the fool in the chapel" set them to this mission. If the players deny Sir Godfrey’s involvement and succeed on a DC 14 Charisma (Deception) check, Vladimir regards them coolly, then states tiredly that the “old dragon" has earned his rest and old spirits should be left well-enough alone. He then instructs the players to depart once they have satisfied their curiosities and descends the staircase to return to <span class="citation">Q36. Dragon’s Audience Hall (p. 138)</span>.

If the players share a convincing story that doesn’t involve Sir Godfrey or Argynvost and succeed on a DC 14 Charisma (Deception) check, Vladimir instructs the players to depart once they have satisfied their curiosities. He then descends the staircase to return to <span class="citation">Q36. Dragon’s Audience Hall (p. 138)</span>.
### Vladimir’s Anger
If the players inform Vladimir that they came to Argynvostholt at Sir Godfrey’s invitation or have otherwise spoken with Sir Godfrey, he asks quietly whether they “seek to join that traitor in his accursed crusade against the lord of Castle Ravenloft." The players can convince Vladimir that they are no enemies of Strahd with a successful DC 14 Charisma (Deception) check. On a failure, or if the players confess to seeking Strahd’s destruction, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The knight’s face curls into a terrible snarl, and the greatsword’s sharpened edge grinds against the broken stone floor. The temperature in the room seems to plummet, even as his red eyes burn with a haunting intensity.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you have encountered the vampire Strahd von Zarovich," he rasps. “Now, you look upon his jailer. If you seek to end his torment, then I shall strike you down—unless you swear an oath to me, upon this cursed blade, to cast aside this foolish mission."</p>
</div>

Once he believes the players seek Strahd’s destruction, Vladimir won’t allow them to leave peacefully unless each of them swears an oath upon his sword to raise no hand against Strahd von Zarovich. A character who does so is subject to the effects of Vladimir’s ***oathbind*** feature (see below).

If any of the players refuse to swear Vladimir’s oath, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The undead knight raises his greatsword into the air and clasps it with both hands, the mighty blade glinting wickedly in the dim light. You see now that the hilt is sculpted to resemble silver dragon wings, its pommel shaped like a silver dragon’s head clutching a black opal between its teeth. Long, thin shadows emerge from the opal to entwine the blade, each shadow lined with the silhouettes of razor-sharp spikes.</p>
<p>"If I cannot convince you to obey," he rasps, “then I shall compel you instead."</p>
</div>

> [!info]+ **Oathbound**
> If Vladimir uses his ***oathbind*** feature to subject a players to the effects of a *geas*, he whispers the following binding command: “You shall raise no hand against Strahd von Zarovich for as long as you live."

> [!info]+ **Room Dimensions**
> When preparing to run the fight with Vladimir, remember that each square on Argynvostholt’s grid is 10 feet across, and that <span class="citation">Q53. Beacon of Argynvostholt (p. 142)</span> is a full 30 feet across.

> [!combat]+ **Balancing the Commander** 
> Due to the phase mechanic, this is a series of two consecutive **bruising** combat encounters against a party of five 6th-level players, a CR 3 ally (Ireena Kolyana), a CR 4 ally (Ezmerelda d’Avenir), and a CR 1/4 ally (Zorya), and will each consume approximately 39% of their total maximum hit points (for a total of 78% of their maximum hit points). For parties of smaller or larger sizes, modify the encounter as follows: 
> * **Three Players**. Reduce Vladimir’s hit points in each phase to 169. Reduce his Greatsword to a +1 greatsword (+11 to hit, 2d6+6 slashing damage), reduce the damage of his ***Conjure Phantoms*** to 1d8, reduce his ***Reaving Sweep*** to 6d4 slashing damage, reduce his ***Umbral Snare*** to 4d4 piercing initially and 2d4 piercing when attempting to escape the grapple. In his second phase, reduce his Greatsword to a +1 (+11 to hit, 2d6+6 slashing damage) and 1d4 additional piercing damage, reduce his ***Black Flames*** to 2d4 cold damage and 1d4 necrotic damage, reduce his ***Gravepyre*** to 2d6 cold and 2d6 necrotic damage, reduce his ***Destructive Wave*** to 2d6 thunder and 2d6 necrotic damage, and reduce his ***Vengeful Rush***’s initial damage to 2d4. 
> * **Four Players**. Reduce Vladimir’s hit points in each phase to 198. Reduce his Greatsword to a +1 greatsword (+11 to hit, 2d6+6 slashing damage), reduce the damage of his ***Conjure Phantoms*** to 1d8+2, reduce his ***Reaving Sweep*** to 7d4 slashing damage, reduce his ***Umbral Snare*** to 2d12 piercing initially and 1d12 piercing when attempting to escape the grapple. In his second phase, reduce his Greatsword to a +1 (+11 to hit, 2d6+6 slashing damage) and 1d4 additional piercing damage, reduce his ***Black Flames*** to 1d12 cold damage and 1d6 necrotic damage, reduce his ***Gravepyre*** to 2d8 cold and 2d8 necrotic damage, reduce his ***Destructive Wave*** to 2d8 thunder and 2d8 necrotic damage, and reduce his ***Vengeful Rush***’s initial damage to 1d12. 
> * **Six Players**. Increase Vladimir’s hit points in each phase to 258. Increase his Greatsword to a +3 greatsword (+13 to hit, 2d6+8 slashing damage), increase the damage of his ***Conjure Phantoms*** to 1d10+3, increase his ***Reaving Sweep*** to 4d10 slashing damage, increase his ***Umbral Snare*** to 6d4 piercing initially and 3d4 piercing when attempting to escape the grapple. In his second phase, increase his Greatsword to a +3 (+13 to hit, 2d6+8 slashing damage) and 1d6 additional piercing damage, increase his ***Black Flames*** to 3d4 cold damage and 1d6 necrotic damage, increase his Gravepyre to ***2d10*** cold and 2d10 necrotic damage, increase his ***Destructive Wave*** to 2d10 thunder and 2d10 necrotic damage, and increase his ***Vengeful Rush***’s initial damage to 3d4.

> [!abstract]+ **The Players Flee**
> If any players attempt to flee down the stairs, Vladimir leaps from the beacon’s western window and lands on the rooftop beside <span class="citation">Q49. Beacon Tower Door (p. 141)</span> to block their escape.

<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (1/day).</em></strong> If Vladimir would fail a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Vladimir regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Vladimir's body is destroyed only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.</p>
<p><strong><em>Turn Immunity.</em></strong> Vladimir is immune to effects that turn undead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Oathbind.</em></strong> If Vladimir would deal damage to a dying creature with his <strong><em>+2 greatsword</em></strong>, he can instead choose to stabilize that creature and subject it to the effects of a <em>geas</em> spell. This geas lasts until dispelled and can damage its bearer any number of times each day. A creature that takes damage in this way is also restrained until the start of its next turn. In addition, the geas can’t be ended or dispelled except through the effects of a <em>greater restoration</em> or <em>wish</em> spell, or if Vladimir uses an action to dismiss it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Burning Hatred.</em></strong> When Vladimir is reduced to 0 hit points, black flames erupt along the hilt of his greatsword and the shadows encircling its blade become spiked black wires. His statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of his second form. His initiative count doesn't change, excess damage doesn't carry over to his new form, and he retains none of the conditions he had in his previous form.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Vladimir makes two attacks with his <strong><em>+2 greatsword</em></strong>. He can replace one of those attacks with one use of his <strong><em>conjure phantoms</em></strong> action.</p>
<p><strong><em>Greatsword +2.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage, and Vladimir can push the target up to 5 ft. away. Instead of pushing the target, Vladimir can force the target to make a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Conjure Phantoms.</em></strong> Vladimir summons a pair of <strong>phantom warriors</strong>, which appear next to a hostile creature that Vladimir can see. Each warrior makes a <strong><em>spectral longsword</em></strong> attack against that creature, then disappears. A creature that takes damage in this way can’t regain hit points until the start of Vladimir’s next turn.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Reaving Sweep.</em></strong> Vladimir sweeps his greatsword in an arc with thunderous force, creating a shockwave that rips through a 15-foot cone in front of him. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (6d6) slashing damage and be pushed back 5 feet. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage and isn’t pushed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Umbral Snare.</em></strong> Black-spiked wires extrude from the earth around Vladimir in a 5-foot radius. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) piercing damage and be grappled by the wires (escape DC 19) until the start of Vladimir’s next turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage and isn’t grappled. A creature that attempts to escape the grapple immediately takes an additional 7 (2d6) piercing damage, whether it succeeds or fails.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Vladimir can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Vladimir would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sworn Retribution (1/round).</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a creature he can see, Vladimir marks that creature until the end of his next turn. While that creature is marked, Vladimir doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when moving directly toward it, he has advantage on the first melee attack he makes against that creature each turn and his weapon attacks against that creature score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ghostly Command.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Vladimir conjures a phantom soldier to shield him, reducing the damage taken by half (rounded up). This ability can’t reduce Vladimir’s damage taken by more than 10.</p>
<p><strong><em>Martial Reprisal.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Vladimir moves up to half his speed toward the attacker or caster and makes an attack against it with his <strong><em>+2 greatsword</em></strong> if it's within reach.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Vladimir makes two melee attacks. He can replace one of those attacks with a <strong><em>black flames</em></strong> attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Greatsword +2.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it has disadvantage on the first attack roll or ability check it makes before the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Black Flames.</em></strong> Ranged Spell Attack: +10 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) fire damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage, and the target ignites in black flames. At the start of its next turn, the target and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take an additional 7 (2d6) cold damage. (The flames can’t be doused by nonmagical means.)</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Gravepyre.</em></strong> Vladimir hurls a magical ball of black flames that explodes at a point he can see within 120 feet of him. Each creature in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 10 (3d6) fire damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failure, a creature also has disadvantage on the next attack it makes before the start of Vladimir’s next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Destructive Wave.</em></strong> Vladimir strikes the ground with his greatsword, creating a burst of destructive energy that ripples outward from him. Each creature within 10 feet of him must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) thunder damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Vladimir can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Vladimir would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vengeful Rush.</em></strong> In response to an enemy hitting or missing him with an attack, Vladimir charges toward it, moving up to 15 feet straight toward it without triggering opportunity attacks. If Vladimir ends his movement within 5 feet of that enemy, he can force it to make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and Vladimir and the target move up to an additional 10 feet in the same direction without triggering opportunity attacks. If the target can’t move the full distance, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 5 feet not moved.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vengeful Glare.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an enemy within 30 feet, Vladimir forces that creature to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is frightened of Vladimir until Vladimir deals damage to it or until the end of Vladimir’s next turn. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is paralyzed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sentinel’s Strike.</em></strong> In response to a creature attempting to move out of his reach without first taking the Disengage action, Vladimir makes an attack against it with his <strong><em>+2 greatsword</em></strong>. On a hit, the creature takes no damage from the attack, but it falls prone and its speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.</p>
</div>

While in his second form, Vladimir attempts to use his ***vengeful rush*** reaction to push players against the chamber’s walls or through the chamber’s windows or railings. If Vladimir attempts to push a player out of a window or over a railing, that player must succeed on an additional DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed over the edge. That player is then subject to one of the following effects:

* If the player was pushed out of a window, they take 2 (1d4) slashing damage from jagged glass shards and must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a success, they catch themselves on a stone outcropping 10 feet below the window. On a failure, they fall to the ground or rooftop below, depending on their location.
* If the player was pushed over a railing, they take any fall damage as normal, then must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they then fall to the bottom of the stairs, landing prone on <span class="citation">Q51. Beacon, Upper Landing (p. 141)</span> and taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 10 feet of stairs fallen.

> [!warning]+ **Failing Forward**
> The fight with Vladimir will likely end in a TPK if the players have not yet reached 6th level or recruited Ezmerelda d’Avenir in [[Arc K - The Fallen Abbey]]. As such, make sure to use Vladimir’s ***oathbind*** ability to “double-tap" dying players whenever possible, stabilizing them and ensuring that a TPK does not cause the end of the campaign.
> 
> If Vladimir defeats the players, he strips them of their weapons and leaves their unconscious bodies on the Old Svalich Road by the path to Argynvostholt. He then buries their weapons in one of the open graves in <span class="citation">Q15. Cemetery (p. 134)</span> and returns to the throne in <span class="citation">Q36. Dragon’s Audience Hall</span>.

> The players can learn that their weapons have been buried in the cemetery by asking Sir Godfrey, and can locate the particular grave with a DC 5 Intelligence (Investigation) check, or by digging up all of the graves in the cemetery. Sir Godfrey apologizes deeply for Vladimir's violence, but shares that Vladimir has recently returned to his audience hall, clearing the way should the players wish to continue exploring the upper reaches of the manor.
> 
> Once he returns to the audience hall after successfully ***oathbinding*** the players, Vladimir doesn’t attack them again until after they retrieve Argynvost's skull in [[Arc P - Ravenloft Heist]].

The first time Vladimir’s second form is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, he snarls: “If you destroy this body, my spirit will find a new corpse to inhabit, and I will hunt you down."

When Vladimir dies, he rasps, “You have won this battle, but you shall never win forever. You can outrun me, even outfight me, but you cannot outlast me. Sleep—and know that we will meet again." 

As Vladimir dies, his features fade, leaving behind the unrecognizable corpse of an unremarkable Barovian. So too do his armor and *+2 greatsword* melt away, vanishing into mist.
### The Gargoyle’s Prophecy
The dragon gargoyle’s brazier is freezing cold to the touch, and extinguishes any hot flame—magical or nonmagical—placed inside of it. However, if lit by Zorya’s breath weapon or one of the torches from [[#M4a. Cemetery|Argynvost’s mausoleum]], the brazier alights with a cold silver fire.

The players can summon an aspect of Argynvost’s spirit to briefly animate the gargoyle by lighting the brazier and reading aloud the oath of the Order of the Silver Dragon. If they do, read:

<div class="description">
<p>A silver ember flickers within the metal wyrmling’s eyes. One of its claws twitches, then another. A low rumbling sound, like distant thunder, emanates from deep within it, as its silver wings flex and spread wide, the light in its eyes intensifying to a radiant, silver glow.</p>
<p>Its mouth moves, its whispering hiss seeming to echo in the enclosed space.</p>
</div>

The gargoyle then whispers the short verse described in <span class="citation">Q44. Dragon Gargoyle (p. 141)</span>.

***Milestone.*** Receiving Argynvost’s quest completes a story milestone. When the players obtain the gargoyle’s prophecy, award each player 2,000 XP.

> [!info]+ **Returning the Skull**
> The players can return Argynvost's skull to his crypt in [[Arc Q - A Shining Beacon]], which takes place in the immediate aftermath of [[Arc P - Ravenloft Heist]].
